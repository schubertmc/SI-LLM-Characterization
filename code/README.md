# Code Folder Overview

This folder contains all code components for our MDplus Datathon 2024 project on the characterization of suicidal ideation heterogeneity using AI. The code is divided into two main parts:

### 1. Characterization of Suicidal Ideation Heterogeneity

- **Location:** `code/mainanalysis`
- **Purpose:** This subfolder includes Python code for accessing and interfacing with Large Language Models (LLMs) as well as R code for downstream data analysis and visualizations.
- **Components:**
  - Access to LLMs for feature extraction and text analysis.
  - Data processing and clustering analysis performed in R for subtype categorization.

### 2. Web Interface Tool for Application

- **Location:** `code/demo_application`
- **Purpose:** This subfolder provides code for a user-friendly web application that implements the AI model to assess and characterize suicidal ideation.
- **Components:**
  - Code for setting up and running the web interface.
  - Instructions for deploying and interacting with the tool.
