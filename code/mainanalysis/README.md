# Analysis Workflow - Documentation

This folder contains the main scripts and configurations for the analysis workflow, including Python scripts for data processing and feature extraction as well as an R script for clustering and downstream analysis.

## Files

### Python Scripts

- **main.py**  
   The primary Python script that runs the LLM interaction analysis workflow.

- **functions.py**  
   Contains functions:
    - **Part 1:** Functions to score the Columbia Suicide Risk Assessment (C-SSRS) questions
    - **Part 2:** Functions for Unsupervised Contrastive Feature Identification
    - **Part 3:** Functions for evaluating extracted features for each post

- **config.py**  
   Holds configuration settings such as file paths, model IDs, and other parameters. Adjusting settings here allows for easy customization without altering the main workflow in `main.py`.

### R Script

- **downstream_analyses.R**  
   This R script performs clustering and downstream analysis on the processed data output from the Python scripts. It includes principal component analysis (PCA), k-means clustering, and additional data visualizations to interpret the clusters. The script reads in data from the output generated by the Python analysis and outputs visualizations and summary statistics.
