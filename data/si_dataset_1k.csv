2277,"""Things will get better"" No they dont. Common thing everyone says to depressed people ""Things will get better"" or something along those lines. Things dont get better. Ive been feeling the same for close to 10 years and all i can say is that ""things will get better"" is a total lie people say to get you to leave them alone. 

Dont get me wrong. Ive said the same thing to many people even tho i know its a huge lie. I find it easy to help others that are in my position by being philosophical and inspirational. But i can never seem to help myself. 

I cant ask for help. Everyone ive ever asked for help has fucked off from my life. The people i didnt say anything to always say ""If anythings bothering you, you can talk to me"" but the minute i try. They bail and i never see them again. I cant open up to people unless ive built a huge trust in them and even then, its immensly difficult. 

I dont even know why i want to die. Yea sure, im not rich. i dont have much in life, i dont have many friends but that doesnt really phase me. Im generally a fun guy but whenever im alone, i have this feeling that who i am is slowly burning away and leaving a huge hole in my soul. I fear that soon there wont be anything left of me. But....it doesnt scare me. I actually am quite indifferent. I feel like even tho the true me will die. A new me will emerge. What scares me is that if that does happen. Ill be even worse of a human than i already am. I try my best to help people. Wether i know them or not, wether i like them or not.

In life i seem very upbeat and fun. But the minute im alone. I want to die.

My mom is blind. My dad died when i was 5 and my sister has a suitcase full of mental disorders. Sometimes i feel that the world would be a better place if my entire bloodline died out. Im the only son with my last name. I feel like if i just dissappeared, the world will get better.

I dont know. When im with people. I really enjoy life. I like making people laugh. I even stream on twitch purely for the purpose of letting people have a good time and so me and my mates can have a laugh. 

Yet still, when im alone, the only thing i think of is death.

I dont expect any replies but theyre all greatly appreciated.

I feel like ive gone on too long and probably surpassed the word limit. And i dont think my mind can handle saying more. So im just gonna post this and hope for some advice outside of ""It will get better"" because it doesnt...

Not sure if this is depression-related or not, although I have been diagnosed with severe depression in the past.  Basically what I've been going insane about is a cutting OCD.  I feel like I *need* to know the pain of having a blade slice into my flesh.  Otherwise, I'll stay up for hours at night because I don't know what it feels like and I want to know what it feels like but I also know it will hurt a lot and I'm afraid of it hurting a lot and I know it would be very bad for me if I were to slice myself.  I have cut myself in the past, but only minor shallow cuts with a sharpened pencil or paperclip on the arms.  To explain this obsession a bit more, it's like if you see someone dying because they ate something insanely spicy and you want to eat it yourself to see how spicy it is.  It would make me feel better if other people experience or have experienced something similar to this, but if not, I guess I've got some pretty serious issues.    ",depression,ID35557_depression,"

1888,"“Never tell me the odds.” : Am I Stubborn or Stupid for Truly Believing Mental Illness Can’t Ruin Our Relationship? I didn’t want to be in love, in fact I didn’t even want to date. Having recently come out of a relationship that ended in the total blindsided abandonment that has been cutely deemed “ghosting” by my generation, the last thing I wanted to do was feel vulnerable in front of another man ever again. But then my friends forced me to get Bumble, get tipsy enough to swipe though roughly fifteen guys our beer goggles deemed hot enough, and I reluctantly set up one date I had every intention of cancelling. 

Except I forgot, until two hours beforehand. And while I do have a somewhat notorious reputation in my friend group for being a bit of a heartless bitch (it comes with the territory when you’re a cute 26 year-old female lawyer in the old boys club, who was largely raised by a progressive and brilliant single dad), I knew cancelling THAT late was rude as hell. So I made the most minimal effort possible, and walked into a date I mentally deemed a failure even before I got out of my car. 

The guy was fine, and for purposes of this post we can call him Jared. He was sweet, and cute, and talked about his career and hobbies in a way that made me want to find anything in life I loved that much.  However, coming out of a relationship of intense passion and constant drunken escapades of a grand scale, everything felt a little flat and I left feeling fairly indifferent about a possible date number two. 

What I did feel was a new confidence to date all of Los Angeles. Over the next few months I continued to go on a stream of first dates with every form of bad boy in the metro area, all of which resulted in vague promises to see each other again that never amounted to anything. The one thing that remained was Jared. He was never there an obtrusive amount, but he also failed to ever let more than a few days pass without interjecting himself into my life in some little way. He remembered everything I told him about myself, and he always had a way of making me feel like the most important person in the room every time he looked at me. But I dismissed his intentions to a degree. At the time I justified my reluctance to open up to Jared as a knee-jerk reaction to his constant eagerness to understand me, but in retrospective I was probably just terrified. I guess I don’t believe in the notion of falling in love, I see it as a constant choice to accept my partner for everything he is. But where Jared was so steadfast in knowing he wanted me and only me, I felt a distinct fear in the same knowledge; and for as much as he should have many times over, Jared never gave up on me. 

Then everything changed. I can’t put into words how and why, because honestly the thought of typing out our story is still too much for me to even consider. I can say that I remember the exact minute I knew I loved him, and that I know with absolute certainty I will never forget that moment. Our relationship wasn’t perfect, but it was built on selflessness and a kind of careful understanding that I’ve never experienced in my entire life. It was painfully real, in a way that still causes me an immense amount of fear knowing I might never see that kind of love again. I allowed Jared to see vulnerabilities I didn’t even know existed, and I never felt more secure in anything than knowing that he would be a constant fixture in my future. I believed him every time he wrapped his arms around me and told me he’d never leave, and I felt so much security in knowing someone appreciated the full value of my flaws and still wasn’t scared.

Then everything changed again, far sooner than was fair to either of us. I can still mentally replay everything about the day Jared left me. A week earlier he cried to me over the phone, explaining that he had a chronic anxiety disorder that cohabited with depressive episodes- one of which had just presented itself in full-force. He pleaded with me to forgive him for not telling me sooner, which just seemed to me to be misplaced concern when all I could spend my energy on was helping provide him the support I knew he would have shown me had the roles been reversed. But despite my best efforts to reassure him that my feelings were unconditional and my fear about our future together non-existent, I wasn’t enough. The man who worshiped me from the day we met ended the relationship we had built on mutual respect over a text message. A text message sent a mere six hours after I went alone to a medical procedure where he had promised to come to provide emotional and physical support. A text message sent three days before we were scheduled to go on our first vacation together. A text message sent nine days before I turned 27. 

Jared explained that he and his therapist agreed that time alone to sort through his own emotional blocks, ones I didn’t even know existed, was necessary. But the last time I checked, he was in a relationship with me- not a doctor who had entered his life a week prior. When I tried to talk to him about the break, all he could tell me was he didn’t know what he wanted. Nothing about our conversation made sense, he went back and forth between telling me he had been considering leaving me for some time and also saying the decision came about so abruptly that he didn’t have time to warn me. I used every tactic I could think of to convince him that his constrain suggestions that I deserved better than him were wrong, and that no decision of this magnitude should be made during a time of such great pain. But most of what I said went ignored, and the rest was met with little acknowledgement and no detectable traces of empathy. He completely denied me any opportunity to have a meaningful dialogue about our relationship, and left me feeling a form of abandonment I didn’t even know existed- one that demonstrated to me that from his current perspective no aspect of our relationship was even worth trying to save. But the worst part was, I didn’t even have a target to direct all my feelings of abandonment, resentment, and anger towards. Because this isn’t him. I’m not dealing with my equal partner, but I’m still dealing with very real and painful consequences of the actions his brain has convinced him are logical and protective. What scares me even more is knowing that I will always, on some level, hope the man I loved comes back to himself and eventually back to me.

I’m an exceedingly bright person and I fully acknowledge so many standby responses to this situation. I understand that he doesn’t want to be so desperate and confused about his mindset. I get that I should consider myself lucky that a shared house, marriage, or family wasn’t impacted. I know that even if he survives this tragic episode of his life, revisiting a relationship might be too much for him or that even despite hard work by both of us it just won’t look the same moving forward. I acknowledge that this will be a part of his person forever, but also wholly discern that dealing with this reality is much less fearful than a life without him. 

I’ve reached out to him a couple times over the course of the past few months that we’ve been apart, always clearly stating that a response isn’t necessary unless he ever decides it to be in his best emotional and mental interest. In doing so I know I’m somewhat robbing myself of the opportunity to fully move on, but the thought of him working through this completely alone is far too much for me to live with. We have varying levels of darkness in our lives, but being strong for him is easy because he has already been the epitome of comfort for me in some of my hardest days.

I am not completely certain why I’m throwing this narrative into the vast void of the Internet, seeing as I’ve yet to find comfort in thousands of other words from every source imaginable. Maybe I just need to know that I’m not alone, or hear that someone else can hear the hurt in my words and understand it would take an especially different kind of person to create those kinds of emotional wounds. But what I think more than anything is that I need reassurance that having hope in love and the strength of our bond is not foolish, no matter how much it can feel that way sometimes.

4575,"I subscribe to sad/drama subs to make me feel better about myself Only thought it was fair that I contribute since I get so much out of reddit.

So I screw up a lot. Like not a trainwreck, 'about to be homeless' sort of way, but still significant. I'm in college, and I get depressed sometimes and during those times I don't do homework or go to classes so don't do well in classes. I'm looking for internships right now but can't find many because my resume isn't that great. I don't include my GPA since it is like 2.8ish so maybe they just know it is bad and don't reply. (CS major so hmu if you know of any internships which don't need like 'rockstar' programmers) 

In the middle of bad bouts, where I just don't want to leave my bed but can't sleep either because I slept for the past 12 hours (I wake up then sleep again just to avoid being awake), I open up this account. Now I only subscribe to a few subreddits, like relationships, offmychest, confession, sadcringe, TrueOffMyChest, and casualiama (this last one I don't remember why). I used to sub to cringe and facepalm, but unsubbed today because I felt they were too mainstream and sometimes even funny. So just realized maybe I was screwed up enough to get this offmychest.

Now when my life isn't doing too good, I go to these subs and read the stories of other people. It's nice when people post happy things here, but I know I mostly come for the sad posts about how people fucked up. I think it is to remind myself that my life isn't *too* bad. relationships sub I think to know that people's current lives are screwed up like my childhood (bad experiences :/ ) 

Funny thing is, I know my life is going okay when I don't use this account. My main account gets a lot more use, and I almost forget about this account.

344,"I love my family, but they are dragging me down So much has happened in my family over the last 10 years. They have gone from my soft place to land to this roiling knot in my stomach that never goes away completely. My mom was diagnosed with an aggressive, resistant form of psoriatic arthritis. The meds doctors put her on and her depression caused her to completely lose touch with her life -- including becoming an opiate addict. She has since quit the meds and is healthier now, but she refuses to admit she was ever addicted. She refused to let anyone help her during that time... my dad and I just had to sit back and watch her slowly kill herself, because she responded with almost violent hostility if you did anything to try to help or confront her. I remember so many times when she was driving to pick my sister up from middle school and nodding out at the wheel. I went with her every time because I was terrified she would kill herself, my sister, or someone else. I remember trying to talk to her while she nodded out at the kitchen table, burning holes in the tablecloth with her cigarette and mumbling nonsense in response to my words. She refuses to admit this ever even happened. This ultimately caused me to essentially ""run away"" into the arms of a total douchebag piece of garbage who more or less left me homeless after 3 months and learning he couldn't control me. Yet I stayed homeless until I found my way clear because it was better than watching her die. During that time she became septic from a spider bite and was hospitalized for 3 months, had multiple surgeries, and literally died on the operating table twice. I didn't even know because I didn't have a phone and had little contact with my family at the time. 

I feel enormous guilt for not being there for her, and especially for not being there for my younger siblings, who were in their mid and early teens at the time. They had such a rough time while she was in the hospital. It was a scary and terrible time for them and they had essentially no one because right before I bugged out my mom filed for divorce from my dad, and he had bugged out too... 

During the time my mom was hospitalized, my dad had succumbed to severe addiction problems of his own. He had become emotionally abusive (not the dad I grew up with) in the last couple of years of their marriage because he felt trapped and angry at watching my mom self-destruct. He became erratic and irresponsible (again, *not* the dad I grew up with). He ""forgot"" to pay the mortgage on the home I grew up in for 27 years... ""forgot"" long enough that my mom and siblings got evicted two weeks after my mom came home from the hospital. When I left, I had no idea I would never be able to see my home again... my *home*... the only home I remember, the place I still think of as my home years later. I don't know if I can forgive him for that, and I don't know what to do with that because I still love him so much.

I can't bring myself to stay angry at him because while all of this was going on, my dad was finally admitting to himself that he is gay. It took him years to come out to the rest of us. It hurts that he didn't think he could tell us. But what hurts more is all the terrible things he did in the interim. He did drugs, he stole from my family, he drained my &amp; my siblings' education savings that my grandparents had set up for us to go to college to pay for drugs &amp; alcohol and whatever else. He was suicidal and duplicitous. I was afraid for his life every day and I knew he was hiding something but I just didn't know *what*. But despite all of that, I feel for him. At almost 60, he finally realized that his whole life had been a lie, that he had never gotten to be the person he really was and now never would really fully get that chance. I feel devastated for him. I wish I could give him back the time he lost, wish I could give him a chance to start over and still have his life in front of him. But I can't and now all his pain is nothing but an object lesson in being yourself, no matter what anyone thinks. That rings so hollow.... it seems like such a heartbreaking waste.

But I *am* still mad at him. I am mad that he wasn't a stronger man. I'm mad that he lied to us so much for so long. He was my hero... no matter what happened, I knew my dad always had my back. And now that man is gone and that hero has been proven to be a huge, terrible lie. He faced a horrible situation and he dealt with it in the most shitty way possible. 

But, so did I. I am mad at myself. I'm mad that I wasn't a stronger person, that I didn't stick it out to be there for my mom and my siblings when they needed me the most. I am mad that I have ALWAYS ran away when things got too crazy, when I didn't know what else to do and I felt trapped. I was a difficult teen and I damaged my relationships with so many people in my family. My parents have forgiven me, but I can't help but think that if I had not caused so much strife, none of this would have exploded the way it did. I weakened the whole structure of our family, so that when the shit hit the fan my family didn't just buckle or cave, it violently exploded. 

And now its in tiny bits that can never be put back together again. I have lost my family forever, but I still see all the pieces of it lying around, like a mockery of the whole... My mom is still there, denying that she ever had any part in anything that happened, polishing her halo, looking down on my father with disgust and feeding my sister lies about him (as if he needed any help looking bad). My brother is still there, distant and unwilling to engage on anything more than a superficial level. My sister is still there, blindly worshiping my ""poor disabled mother"" and hating my ""evil, malignant father"". My father is still there, a broken shell of himself who will never really be whole. But all of the pieces are irrevocably changed and they will never fit together again. My family has died and I have spent years feeling absurdly like somehow, things are going to settle down and everything will be okay. But it isn't okay. It just gets worse because none of the problems get fixed or even talked about honestly, they just fester and rot. 

I don't know what to do. I miss them and I love them, but it is agonizing, maddening to be around them. I can't talk to them about any of this because every time I have tried, it has ended in a screaming fight(my sister &amp; mom) or outright denial (my mom &amp; dad) and I become the villain. I can't talk to anyone about this because no one understands and I don't think it would help anyway and I don't want to burden other people with this horrible, tangled, tawdry mess. I worry on this constantly, it is always in the back of my mind, always distracting me, always this taunt hum of tension that never goes away. It gets in my way, it keeps me from focusing, it keeps me from sleeping, it keeps me exhausted. 

Thank you for listening. I don't know what to do with all of this, the pressure just builds and builds... I feel like I am full to overflowing, full to bursting and soon I will explode and the irrevocably broken pieces of me will mirror the irrevocably broken pieces of my family.

2729,"As detailed of a description of why I hate my life. First of all, I suffer from depression and anxiety, which cripples everything in my life I try to achieve or do. I've gotten to a new low. First off, in my current state of mind, I am a procrastinating, pessimistic, lonely asshole. Here is a brief list that I was advises by my doctor to make. Things I am very unhappy with in life.

1. I hate my living situation; I live with my parents and I want to run away and never see any of them again.
2. I don't want to disappoint or upset my parents so number 1 is a contradiction.
3. I hate kids. I have to deal with my nephew and my sister which live with my parents as well at the age of 28. 
4. I hate that I have to hide my habits from my parents to keep them happy. (Smoking, dipping tobacco, drinking alcohol)
5. Because of these habits I wish to move out even more but can't.
6. My financial situation is paycheck to paycheck. 
7. I hate my job so much that sometimes I daydream (or nightdream on nightshift) of sticking a fork in an electrical socket, or running away completely and starting over and probably end up homeless. (Being homeless sounds much simpler than regular life but I know isn't very good of a life either)
8. I hate that I sometimes talk shit about my friends because of their faults, but I can't even deal with mine. (I'm a hypocrite.)
9. I hate that in the past year I've gone back on all my morals and became the people I hate to serve at my store. (Wanting to drink to excess, smoke, steal, etc.) It has gotten to the point to where a few times a month I will steal stuff from my own store, and I hate that about myself.



That's pretty much it for now. Each thing goes very deep down the rabbit hole. But I fear there is nothing I can do to save myself. Each day I get closer to wanting to walk out the door, go to the store and get a shotgun (say its for hunting) and shoot myself in the head. I don't want to die though. I will do everything I can to keep from doing this what feels like inevitable thing.",depression,ID39825_depression,"

 it's not like I'm living a bad life, I'm an unhealthy 18yo living at home playing video games to forget his problems.

It's all such a huge hassle and every time my mind isn't occupied by video games I'm stuck sat there trying to think of a reason to live.
I'm a dull sarcastic person that doesn't really care about ""making memories"" nor can I really care about ""how selfish suicide is"" as people have told me because what have you got to regret once your dead?

850,"Don't want to continue. Why should I continue... if there is nothing but pain and tragedy ahead? I've paid all of my dues, since I have hit rock bottom yet again, and I no longer want to be here, but it is only out of some morbid, distant, very vague sense of duty that I'm still around.

To be honest, I always feel and felt forced into getting into situations, or even hooking up with certain women, that I never loved, and am always forced into things though I am completely against them. I can never be with who I want to, and then another side of my comes out and says you don't need anyone. I am constantly swapping between personas throughout each day, probably out of split personality disorder.

I'm tired of being told what to do. How would you like it? Yet... you do it to me, and I'd rather be fucking dead, not having to play this game any more. I want to quit the game, and I utterly don't give a fuck. It's hard to continue, when you can never have the questions answered that you want answered, and also when you can never even begin to have faith that the person you dream of being with is actually even possible, and it isn't. It's just another deception, like all of the deceptions my entire life has been. This life is literally about reproducing and experiencing the world. That's literally it, there's nothing more to life than that, and I just can't compete in the game. Too much harm has been inflicted on me, and I simply can't handle any more. I can't handle anything more, and all I ask is nothing, because there's nothing to ask for, nothing to gain, and nothing for me to lose.

I've had enough.

You know how people say, ""Do what you love and you'll be successful?""
My honest response to that, is that I love to do nothing but sleep and disassociate from the world. I don't actually enjoy doing anything, and thus I cannot do what I love.

5080,"New job stressing me out, I need advice/to vent I was hired in October at a big retail chain. I had just quit a cafe job after 3 weeks due to constant panic attacks ( yes, it was that horrible and anxiety inducing). I applied to work in the clothing area of the store, but was hired as a cashier because I wasn't going to be full time.

Since then, I've been getting 35-40 hours a week. Today is my first day off after working 8.5 hour days 6 days in a row. I feel exhausted. They agreed to 20-25 hours at the most. The customers at this job are very entitled, rude, and full of themselves. I'm very shy and have social anxiety which makes this job worse. I pretty much hate it, except for a lot of the people I work with. The managers are really rude, uncaring, and my main manager is so rude whenever I see she's working for the day I want to leave. 

I have family coming for Christmas I haven't seen in YEARS, and every day they'll be here I'm working all day. The only day we'll be together is Christmas. I tried talking to a manager who basically told me they're not doing anything about my hours. About 7 other people I work with complained to them about not getting the hours they requested as well.  I'm just angry the day my family is coming I'm working 8.5 hours, then the next day I work all day, and the next day (Christmas Eve) the same thing. I told a manager I will be taking 5 classes starting first week of January and her response was ""Well, I mean, we can look at your schedule but you're probably not gonna get the amount you want.""

My best friend died in 2016, 2 friends died in 2017. The pain has made me push my remaining friend and family all out of my life because i am very introverted with my emotions. Now i am alone.

Context: 18 years old, male from Europe. English isn’t my first language, so excuse the grammar.
Everything seems so fucking pointless, I don’t want to do anything and I’m really struggling. I think I have developed anorexia at least to a certain point. Probably had something to do with feeling in control. That, and being too lazy to even eat sometimes or binging on pizza so much I feel disgusting. I also wanted to look skinnier, seeking some sort of a validation, thinking at least I will look good. Well, I thought getting 700 likes on Instagram was going to make me feel better (yes, I’m a self loathing narcissist, who would’ve thought) but, apparently, not really. I binged yesterday, now I weigh 67 kg again (am 185cm, weighed 72kg about 2 months ago) and I feel fucking disgusting. Also, I’m also almost a year in a relationship and I’m still not sure if I love him. I think I would or I do, I just can’t understand or process it because of my mental state. School also sucks. I feel like the teachers bring me down and demotivate me a fucking lot, even when not intended. Or I’m just a lazy fuck and I’m looking for someone to blame. I wanted to apply to study abroad but guess how’s that going along. Well, either way, I don’t want to study at all, but I feel pressured to do so by my friends, teachers and family. I can’t focus in school, might be that I’m either that lazy that I’m letting my future crumble in front of me or I don’t know. Eh. My boyfriend says it’s not a big deal, I can retake my exams any other year in case of failing but I can’t find a single fuck to give even about that. I don’t want to pass or fail the exams. I don’t want to study or work, but still here I am - stressing my balls over it. All I want to do is starve myself into nothingness, but that’s not a great idea considering I would hurt the people that care about me, and they didn’t (at least intentionally) do anything wrong. I’m not a monster, I just feel like all of this is pointless. I want to escape reality, sleep through all the hard times and wake up when everything’s sorted. No one is going to sort it out for me though, I have to do it myself but once again, I’m too unmotivated for that! All I’m motivated for is hating myself and staying in my room while occasionally leaving for a coffee and taking selfies while chain smoking. My friends, on the other hand, are getting invited to interviews on prestigious universities and shit. It’s hard not to compare myself to others in such situations. Anyway, I’m too tired to write more so... whatever. Maybe you guys will give some insight, just keep in mind that recommending to seek professional help isn’t an option for me because my mom is a psychologist and we live in a small fucking town, so she knows every colleague of hers, and they also know me. Wouldn’t risk her finding out, because whatever you say, confidentiality isn’t very important in this town. I know.

Speaking of which, I think I started self harm so young and kept at it for so long that it just became my first line to cope.  I can’t run forever, and drawing barely touches it.

1644,"Same ole shit add the previous post. Same ole shit as the previous post. (Can't edit typos in titles unfortunately.)

So, Thanksgiving is over and it's time to start thinking about December plans.

My parents have a fairly large house and holidays have always been hosted there. (The following sort of crap wouldn't be happening if my parents were hosting) But this year my brother wants to host at his (smaller) new place. He and his wife starts a group chat to discuss potluck and secret Santa plans. 

We all sort of dislike my aunt (dad's sister) but not her daughter. Aunt's apparently being boycotted because of her ""holier than thou"" and ""know it all"" attitude. But that presents two problems. Grandma is in the chat and should not be expected to keep a secret from her own daughter, and the aunt's daughter can't be invited even though she's totally cool. Secondly, she's my dad's sibling and his other sibling is being invited plus his kids (who are close to the cousin that can't be invited.) Did you get all that?

I understand wanting to keep distance from this aunt but it's still morally wrong. To include a portion of the family that she belongs to (dad's siblings) but exclude her is so not going to go over well at all. The kids are gonna talk. Grandma doesn't need that stress.

But you know what? This is the type of man my brother has become. A selfish prick that loves to control everything. And he married someone right up his alley.

Now I'm in the chat and they flat out say she's not included but try to play it off like there's not enough room at their house. I have access to a large conference room for free because of my employment and it's conveniently located. I offer the space as a solution and am told that it's really not about room but actually avoiding her because she's disliked.

So I drop it. Do not want to touch that with a 10 ft pole.

Next bit:

I had previously not been asked about scheduling or anything prior to this chat so I start asking about timing and such of the party and inform the group that I'm working Christmas 2nd shift but am off before 3pm and also on x mass eve. 

I am told, bluntly, that considerations had been made already to include the most people and arrangements can't be changed last min for just one person.

Um... It's still fucking November and no considerations were made for me because I have apparently been completely excluded on communications. No one bothered to ask me what my schedule was like. 

It seems to me that my brother made considerations for his favorite people and everyone is just expected to conform to his own conveniences or ""too bad so sad"".

I said, ""well I guess I'm out then"" and promptly left the chat.

It seems that my depression symptoms are highly situational (which makes me question their validity in the first place) because I couldn't deal with the sudden onslaught of shame, betrayal, and hurt that I suddenly felt. I had to step away since I was at work at the time and cry in the back away from customers. 

My sister is my night in shining armor. She checked up on me almost immediately. My boyfriend tells me that I'm not crazy, that he sees exactly what I see when it comes to my family. He even thinks they're more toxic toward me (as evidenced by their behavior toward others, like my aunt) than even I admit. But everyone else gets pissed at me for feeling hurt. My mom can't handle it and starts going off on how selfish I am. My sister copies and pastes what's going on in the chat after I left and in there my brother is busy justifying his assholery to the group, and my sister defends me by saying ""she never demanded anyone change the plans. She politely asked if it was possible."" 

Gosh, the whole length of time that I was in that chat was less than 30 min. And the wall of emotions that hit me afterwards was like a ton of bricks. Bam! Immediate and brutal. I guess I'm still raw from the events of Thanksgiving so recently but this was.... Just painful.

On another note, my future in laws are Hispanic. I'm whiter than a ghost. I find it similar to culture shock when I'm around them. So far, my MIL loves me to pieces and misses me when it's been too long. She's an awesome woman. The culture part is hard because sister in law's in laws invite EVERYONE over for any celebration. Nice big, typical gathering of multiple branches of family that aren't a part of the same tree. My finance is not related to his sister's in laws. But we're all invited. And they have a shared culture that I just don't relate to. I find it hard to find my place. I'm shy as hell and half the food is scary to me since I was never raised on it. Conversation is hard because I know so little Spanish. I'm always so scared to offend someone by not understanding through their accent, or hearing/saying the wrong thing. I get so worn out from the social setting that I can only handle about an hour before I start to feel sensory overload. But I can't leave without upsetting someone because it looks like in throwing their hospitality in their face. 

They want me to participate in a secret Santa. Individually. As in, I get a name and a gift and my fiance gets another name and gift. And we're not treated as one entity (which I would have preferred). And if I don't draw my mother in law's or sister in law's names then I'm screwed. Because everyone else is part of this other family that I know nothing about.

I've never had an actual anxiety attack but in the last two years I feel like I'm getting closer and closer to literally experiencing one. 

And here's where my brain is torturing me again. It keeps telling me that I'm more wanted by these strangers than my own family. And I can't bring myself to celebrate the fact that people do love me and want to have my presence because it's overshadowed by this idea that I'm not important to the people that should be obligated to love me.

The way my family treats me is subtle enough to make me always question if it's all in my head and I'm overreacting, or if something is really going on and I'm not crazy.",depression,ID2591_depression,"

4914,"TW: Childhood Sexual Abuse. Again, TW: Childhood Sexual Abuse. Please be safe.

So here’s my situation. I come from a tight-knit, highly functional, loving and supportive, average suburban family. Two loving parents, two kids; no dog or minivan or picket fence, but the rest is a postcard. And no one has ever known that when I was fourteen I was sexually abused by my brother multiple times while I was sound asleep.
As a freshman in high school, I started crying uncontrollably, dropping weight unhealthily quickly, acting out in ways I never had, and my previously excellent grades dropped through the floor. Rather than observing that this sudden change was an almost surefire indicator, my well-meaning parents figured I was “having a rough time adjusting to high school” and had me put on lots and lots of medication for depression and ADHD. No therapy, no follow up, just lots of pills that made me sweat and sheared off my highest highs and lowest lows from a doctor with coke-bottle glasses and a bow tie; he had refills upon refills for me, but did absolutely nothing to help. I remember him so well. If any family member, teacher, school counselor, therapist, choir director, youth group leader, Girl Scout leader, or stranger on the street had ever asked me what had happened, I was ready to tell them, but no one ever did.
.
So now it’s sixteen years later, and my family is still highly functional and tight knit, and every time we gather as a group, I am there with an abuser with whom I hold hands to say grace at dinner, and grittingly hug as we greet and depart. I have watched my brother the “quiet introvert” who has “not great social skills” because he is “shy” drop out of and then re-enroll and graduate (much to my parents’ pride and joy) from college, find a great job, excel in his music career, buy a house, marry a beautiful woman and have a beautiful baby daughter. I stood beside him at his wedding because he asked me too. I waited and waited for any indication that my sister in law knew who she was marrying. She didn’t.
.
Here’s why I bring all of this up. It seems that some therapy and (if I’m reading the timing right) #metoo has gotten the best of his guilty conscience, and after half a lifetime of unapologetic silence, he has decided to come out of the woodwork and ask to start a dialogue with me. Not for it’s content, just for it’s sheer existence, the email that he sent has dropped me. I waited a couple of days and sent him back a painful and vicious account of what my experience has been and told him that if he wants to do anything about it he can a) go to many years of therapy, and b) tell his parents.
.
And then he did. He dropped everything and drove a hundred miles to sit down with our parents and tell them. Everything. I think he may have even read my email to them.
.
It’s been three weeks, and I am living in hell. It’s like everything that I’ve ever buried has just newly happened, every single night. I am back in the end of eighth grade, crying on the floor of the bathroom because it’s the only room in the house with a door that locks. Every day, I’m experiencing nausea, sometimes vomiting. I’m putting on weight faster than anyone should. I haven’t done work at work in a month. I’ll sit in my car in a parking garage for hours and hours before being able to turn the key. I’m sleeping twice as much as usual but am still always, always heavily exhausted. Sometimes I’ve fallen asleep in bed fully clothed with my shoes on, and last night I found myself sleeping on the floor in the middle of my living room. My neck and shoulders hurt debilitatingly. I’ve started to refer to my near-daily occurrence of “scream-crying”. My vision is in and out of blurry or spotty and yesterday I made bacon and the sizzling sound hurt my ears like I was at the front row of a rock concert. I have wonderful friends and a job and a car and cats and an apartment. My life is okay. What the hell is happening to me?
My parents are trying, but the worst thing in the world I can think of right now is words of comfort and assurance that it’s all going to be okay--that millions of people over the whole history of time have had experiences like this and healed from them (thanks, Mom). I have a therapist, and she is very nice and was very helpful earlier this year working with me while I prepared for and recovered from ending a four-year relationship with a manipulative and controlling partner (that’s a whole other post), but now dealing with this new revelation, she is utterly ineffectual. I have cancelled my last two appointments with her; it’s not worth it. I’ve started calling psychiatric practices, and have gotten hard nos or non-responses to my first fourteen (actually fourteen) attempts, but I guess that’s something I’ll keep working on. It turns out lots of people need help and psychiatrists are busy.
I think I’m writing all of this down and putting it here just to see if anyone has ever felt like this? Does any part of this story resonate in any way with anyone here? I feel helpless. I feel empty. I feel so completely alone. I’m just trying to find help and stay alive and right now that is a battle that I am taking hour by hour. Would you be willing to talk to me? Or lend any suggestion or wisdom for anything I might be able to do next? Intellectually, I think I know that someday things will feel different, and that time does, somehow, heal, but right now I can’t feel it. I just so desperately want it to be over.

A little back story; Was with ex from 17 years old to 29 years old, married have two kids ages 9 and 11, divorced when I was 30. He couldn’t handle my BP1 diagnosis and the inevitability of my mental illness disability. It is what it is, I am better off actually having people who support me no matter my mental state. They are few and far between but they do exist. Fast forward, found a GREAT man. Super supportive. Loves me and all of my crazy, encourages me to do things I couldn’t do when I was with ex (or alone) and is literally helping me be my very best self. Improvements are everywhere. I needed someone to help me out of the early grave that I dug for myself and he did just that. I can see myself spending forever with him and that is my intention..

Why am I so nervous?! Like every day closer to the date I get a little more nervous. What am I going to do if he doesn’t show up? He’s got a big wedding planned. What if he figures out in a day or a week or 6 months or 6 years down the road he decides to give up like my ex did? I am nauseous just thinking about this shit. And like I keep having these nightmares where I’m standing in my dress in front of everyone and he’s standing in front of me and then he gives this crooked smile and like unzips himself and it’s really my ex and I wake up immediately. I hate myself for even posting that, he’s probably reading this. But damn man, my brain is fucked up because of these thoughts. They’re always so negative. It sends me into places I don’t want to go. Why does my brain play on a time loop? Like I find a time I subconsciously want to focus on I guess and bam; I’m stuck. Being with my ex is NOT a time loop I want to be stuck in.

3494,"Help I'm really sorry for being a bother and I'm sorry if this is unreadable, but bear with me please.

I'm 15 years old, so maybe this is just me being lazy and ungrateful, but I want to drop out of school. 

These past months, I've been skipping school. I can't learn anything; my head just refuses to take anything in. I always have this heavy feeling of homesickness.

So I started pretending and lying to everyone. In the mornings, I pretend to prepare for going to school, then once everyone leaves, I stay at home. Then I message my friends that I don't feel well, even if I'm perfectly fine. I don't do anything productive the whole day, I just refresh Reddit and Youtube over and over again. I try to do the things I like to do like video games and stuff, but the guilt just stops me from enjoying my hobbies. 

The only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fact that I can't have my parents go through all that pain, and I want to somehow give back to them and make them feel like all the money they spent on me wasn't a waste.

I keep telling and convincing myself to go to school the next day, but as the days of absences pile up, so does the pressure I feel. I tried to talk to my parents about this, but then I realized that they won't understand because I don't have a concrete reason for feeling this way.

I'm not being bullied, I don't have extremely close friends but I do  have friends, and it's not like I have a bad reputation at school. The schoolwork's not that bad either and I am perfectly capable of doing them, but I just don't want to. I had high grades last grading, but due to my absences, they have probably dropped. 

My parents have always been reminding me that I have it easy, that all I have to do is study, that all I'm good for is my grades, and I know that it's true. All I have going for me is that I'm a bit ""smarter"" than my classmates, and now I don't even have that.

I know that I'll get in trouble for doing all these and that I'm being a burden to my parents. I'm not even officially diagnosed, yet I feel like I'm depressed. I've been reading through the posts in this sub to find similar people to me, but they all have legitimate reasons and I don't. My parents probably don't even understand depression.

I'm going to try and talk to my mother again tomorrow about this. I doubt that she'll understand though. I myself don't really get the point of this post, but if you read it all the way through, thank you very much and sorry for being an inconvenience.

I’m so down in the dumps all I want to do is sleep or die in a hole or be a loaf ( what my friend calls me when I’m too depressed to get out of bed and curl up into blankets)  i want to start self harming again but I’m really fighting the feeling too. I’m starting to have a mental breakdown over where my life is and how I’m going nowhere and how everything is meaningless. I know this is textbook depression and that it will pass but I can never fully shake the feeling or thought that this is forever. I saw my therapist today and she told me to call my psychologist which I just don’t have the energy to do it was hard to even get to my appointment. I don’t know what’s wrong with me all I know is that this depression is heading down really bad and if I can’t stop it I’m afraid i might need to go to the hospital again. :/ I just need to let this all out. ,bipolar,ID20657_bipolar,"

I have experienced many episodes of depression and low mood for years. Recently, over the past three years, my girlfriend has helped to pull me out or to be my safety net.

However, last time was too much. She was pushed too far. She left and I felt alone and helpless. Like I couldn't do it. That's when I ended up in the mental health unit.

Since coming out I have been up and down. I have thought many times about ending my life. Two nights ago I made a load of audio recordings to the people closest to me and put them on a USB drive and online storage to be opened after I'd ended it. The plan was to get drunk and jump off a bridge. I contacted a friend to see if he fancied a drink and we drank and I opened up and he made me feel like I didn't want to go through with it. So, I didn't.

4200,"i'm feeling wrong again hey everyone~ 

hope you're all starting this year full of goals and happiness 😊

i feel weird talking about this here, but i don't have  anywhere else to put this, or anyone i can tell

so i've been struggling with an eating disorder for about 4 years, i've told very few people about it and this last few weeks i've been feeling really huge, absolutely ugly, like a fat ugly scary monster

it always happens though during this time because of all the food i end up eating, and i'm usually used to it but it's been very hard for some reason this year

i've been crying non-stop and my eyes are red and swell, my body is incredibly huge, my mind is foggy and i feel really alone

i realized that i will never get over it if i don't agree to get help, but every time i try to reach out for help everyone tells me it's impossible for me to feel that way since they do not see me fat or unhealthy at all

and i'm so tired now i've relapsed, i feel so misunderstood, so weird

my bpd is not making the situation any better and i've been reading that we are one of the worst kind of people to deal with and i feel like the worst piece of shit that has ever existed

i feel i'm a huge burden for my family, i feel like everyone can't stand me, i feel like they wish i could be the girl i used to be but i can't and i feel so wrong 

i wish i was normal again so badly, i wish meds worked and i wish people didn't tell me they wish i just wasn't quite the way i am

i feel so sorry for all of the people i hurt

i just feel really tired of trying and i don't think anyone will ever love me because bpd is the absolute worst kind of personality disorder and there is no cure for it and neither there is for anorexia and i feel so helpless

1445,"I'm not used to things going well and I'm scared. I've had positive things happen but they never ultimately end up that way. Something positive happens and then something else happens to negate it or just makes my situation worse than it previously was in the end. I'm extremely cautious, which I think is a good thing to an extent, but not the way I am. Right now it's like I'm just waiting for the sky to fall. I have no idea what terrible thing is going to happen but at this point I expect it as an inevitability. 

I've been depressed since I was at least 6. I have journals starting from that age that make that much painfully obvious. I have a pretty extreme reduced affect display. I don't handle feelings well. I chastise myself when I feel things strongly, especially about other people. I am extremely guarded. I will suffer through anything in order to not rely on other people. I do not think about my happiness at all; I've never been able to until this point. All I've focused on is my survival in the barest sense. I do not like being weak or showing any form of weakness or vulnerability. The one thing I'm certain of is that I'm depressed and have been for over 20 years, and I came to the realization for the first time today when thinking about this shit: I have no idea what it's like to not be depressed. 

I have no idea what it's like to wake up and not think about not wanting to live. I've never attempted suicide. I've thought about it, but never even gotten close to making an earnest attempt, which is why that is phrased as ""not wanting to live"" as opposed to ""wanting to die."" I called a suicide hotline when I was a teen and hung up after talking for a few minutes, apologizing for taking up the time of someone who was ""more suicidal"" than me. But I think about it all the time. Whenever I'm not doing something or talking to someone or listening to music, that's the exact thought I have. It's like that's just my default setting. 

I don't think I want to die, I just want to stop existing like this. I want to stop being on edge. I want to be able to acknowledge my own feelings. I want to stop purposely cutting people off and making them feel bad because I decided to isolate myself because of the fucked up shit that's happened to me. I want to be able to do something as simple as telling him how I feel about him without referring to my emotions as stupid. I want to feel like it's okay to care about myself without feeling like I'm being selfish or a burden. I want to be able to write here that I want to be able to trust people without hesitation because I'm not really sure I want to trust people because they've always been untrustworthy and disappointing. I want to relax for a single moment.

Every therapist I've been to has made a remark a bout how I've ""lost a lot"" in reference to other people, or that I have been let down a lot by others and that this is probably where my issues stem from. Those statements are true, but at this point also not, in a way. I stopped relying on and expecting things from people when I was a preteen, and I've never allowed myself to since. When I expect nothing, I can't be let down and I can't be upset when they leave. At least, this is what I imagine my subconscious was thinking when I developed this defense mechanism. Cut your losses and move on. 

I told him that and he said that he hopes he doesn't let me down. I hate that my first thought was that he probably will be because I really, really don't want him to. 

This is the first time I've done something purely because I feel like it and it's terrifying. The only reason I think I've been able to justify going through with it is that even if things don't work out, the city he lives in has much better job opportunities than the one I'm in now. And I don't have healthcare here, but I will there. Leaving here doesn't matter. I've lived here my whole life but there isn't anything for me here. It's more expensive and louder than it is there. But I'm moving 4100 km and across a border (I'm already a citizen of the country thankfully) to live with him. I'm alone, and therefore safe, here. But he makes me smile, and every time we've been together has been fun and I'm pretty sure I felt happy, and that's weird as hell and throws me off and scares me. He is extremely excited for me to be moving there, and so am I when I stop to think about my feelings. We have taken our relationship very slow because of our natures, and I tell myself that because we were hesitant and did not rush things that this is not an awful idea, but that doesn't make it less scary because I'm ultimately doing this because of how much I like him and confronting that thought makes me feel inexplicably weak and pathetic.

I've made no secret of how guarded I am and how fucked up my childhood, family, and most of my life has been, but I've never gone into great detail I've mostly spoken about it sarcastically or while making a joke. He's similar in a lot of ways, so he understands, I think. But I wonder if maybe I'm wrong and he doesn't understand at all and once I'm comfortable to actually talk about myself and be open, it will have been a huge mistake and I'll have yet another reason to be a jaded misanthrope.",off_my_chest,ID314_off_my_chest,"

I can't be bothered to do anything and I have waited 15 years for that feeling to pass. I am meant to be looking for a property but I don't care about my life at all. I wanted to work on something this holidays so I had something to hold onto but I didn't do anything as expected.

2020,"Got laid off from my second job in a row, wondering if I'm cut out for this game of life. I don't even really feel sad, happy or anything really, I just feel hollow. This is one of many major disappointments in a row for the past fuck knows how long in my life, in fairness this one was entirely my fault but I just don't know if I'm really cut out for this. Anything I do or attempt I seem to fail at, I honestly can't remember the last time anything truly good happened to me. 

I know that in ways I need to change things about myself but I don't know what those things are. I know I shouldn't blame others for my problems but so many things have not exactly helped, for instance being bullied severely both physically and mentally for most of my school life has not helped my mental wellbeing in adult life. I have basically zero confidence in any situation, very anxious all the time, all round just a nervous wreck who has difficulty trusting others. 

My home life doesn't help either, my parents wonder why I never spend time downstairs with them without realising they are both the reason I don't. They don't exactly have a happy marriage, a large part of their time is spent at each others throats arguing over the most stupid shit possible. And I know that my mum will instantly jump on my back for this when she finds out rather than provide any support. 

I dont go out a lot and spend a large percentage of my time online as I feel safe there and that nobody can hurt me. Being a 23 year old man as well I feel like the stigma stops me from saying anything, I've hinted to people I'm not well at all but they don't seem to pick up on it and I feel if I do speak up either nobody will listen or somebody will claim I'm exaggerating or to get over it. Thing is, if someone I care about is in similar pain or predicament I always go out of my way to help in any way I can. But the second I need help I'm fobbed off. I'm always having to do something for someone and never be able to expect anything when I need the same help.

I mean what good am I to anyone or any company if I'm too stupid to even hold down a call centre or retail job. And given my brains and education I'm no good to any higher paid or rewarding job/course :( I have so many careers I would love to do but again, given my grades and what not theres not a snowballs chance in hell I'm getting into that. 

I feel as though I was unfairly dismissed, to give you the rundown I worked for a centre processing wine orders over the phone for Christmas as a temp worker. Now granted I only had six days left anyways but it doesn't make it any less degrading to have this happen again. Last place was because they guy training me wasn't actually training me at all, when telling me to do something he would be so blunt it was unreal. This time it was because users had given me the wrong info in terms of delivery addresses, not my fault as I can only go on the info they give me, but HR saw it differently and saw me as ""a financial burden to them"" and let me go. 

I feel this was totally unfair as I can't learn from my mistakes if you don't show me how to correctly use the system, but theres no point in arguing with the greedy fat cats upstairs. I'm never gonna win against them. I never thought I'd ever be so beaten down by life to the point that I'm seriously considering just stepping out of the race and sleeping forever. I don't know what I ever did to be dealt such a shitty hand in life but if it were possible to change it, I'd snatch that opportunity up in a heartbeat. 

Sorry for the rant guys, I just needed this off my chest, and if I do choose to end it, I wanted someone to read this as my last entry if you want to call it that. 

TLDR: Got laid off again, don't fancy being here anymore as I feel like I'm no use to society.",suicide_watch,ID5235_suicide_watch,"

I've had PTSD since I was a pre-teen. This hell has also unleashed a Bipolar Disorder that I've had at least since age 17. 

Before you say, I have tried many years of therapy and different therapists. I've been seeing a psychiatrist since I was a child. 

In a last attempt at seeking help, I made a kind of emergency appointment with my doctor. He gave me a new medicine to try for my Bipolar depression. It isn't covered by my insurance. HAHA! The thing is, as someone with manic depressive disorder, I can't take your run of the mill anti depressants. This wasted my supporter's time... his leave from work. It wasted my time because I cry when I think about it. And its going to cost us a lot of money just to have seen him. 

I can't work. I fail at any new job, including failing at a job I kept for around 8 years. I just fell apart, and I've been rejected by SSDI in the United States many times. 

I want nothing more than a rope around my neck. For technical reasons, it will have to be a belt. This means that I will suffer more than usual, and the rate of success varies. However, I will be home alone for many hours. 

I can't stand the trauma, the daily nightmares, the ultradian cycling (mood switches every few hours). I don't feel this is selfish. I'm in SO MUCH PAIN to live for other people. SO MUCH PAIN. 

I don't have a suicide note, so I figured that I'd post here. Someone will know where to find this.

1686,"I don't want to die I want to live but considering the situation I see myself in, I am not really sure about that. Some context:

I was born a curious child, always thinking about things around me. My father had died before I was born, so I guess I never missed him. My mother is a single mom and she is a police officer. I am her only son. Next, coming to the age of 12, I took to books and writing. I read plenty and wrote a lot. Silly poems and such but I enjoyed it. Even in the school, I mostly took to myself and my naive poems throughout the day. I couldn't care less about my academics. I had never been a bright student. I didn't understand the need to waste my time on preparing for exams and alll that sort of stuff. Howerver,  I wasn't against learning, actually I loved to learn about things. Everytime I got into a new grade, I would read up all the new academic material but I couldn't be bothered to remember anything. I was into knowing. I didn't care about retaining it. Moving on, when I was 17 I met a girl through Facebook, she was very friendly. I had never interacted much with the other gender. My school was an all-boys, catholic instituition. So you could know my disposition. Well, I felt at ease talking to her, very much so infact, I decided to meet her. I met her at a place, I was with my one friend ( I had progressed by then to make 3 total friends), I saw her and said to him I don't feel any physical attraction towards her. 

Let's call this girl P. After a lot of intimate talks and very comfortable moments with P, eventually we came into a relationship. I didn't think that much about the attraction part. Due to reasons, she had to move to a new city. We went to long-distance. I was at an age where I had to get into a college now. I didn't even prepare for anyone. I did get through in one which was in her city. She arranged all my papers and everything for me to get into that colllege. I moved to her city then.

By the end of college we had about 3 years of a very, very comfortable and honest relationship. Although, its important to see it from her perspective. She is an over-achiever. She always tried to do everything for us to work, even sometimes lying about little things that she thought might affect my mood. We were completely honest except that.

Last year of college, I had made a lady friend in the college. At one of the crazy parties. I made-out with her. I had always been loyal and so had P been. I couldn't understand what happend. I called P next morning. I told her everything. She was of-course completely broken. She had complete trust in me ( so had I, in this matter at least). But we talked and talked a lot, and eventually she forgave me. Her logic was that of course I won't do this again. It was just because of drinks. 

I got out of college and again didn't do too well but I had learned a lot. I was literally the most knowledge-able person in my class. That was clear. Everybody wanted me to help them with her projects and stuff. I had all the practical knowledge about my field. During the same time, I got published by a small publisher and got my novel out finally. But something broke after that, I never dared to write seriously again. 

Moving on, I got an internship in yet another city. I moved and eventually was doing okay. P was also (as usual for her) doing extremely good in her academics and such. I met an old mutual friend of ours in that city. She was a junior of P from her school. She was studing in this city. Soon, she started to come over at my place. It was all casual and friendly. I really enjoyed her company as she had simliar interests. It came to the point where she would come over for the entire weekend and we would just talk the entire day and sleep together ( but quite in our own space).  

P was fully aware of this but slowly she began to notice that I was giving her way less time than I ought to. Let's call the other girl A. So A, was really enjoying my company as I was too. On the eve of my birthday, I had to catch a flight back to meet my mother as she always wants to spend all my birthdays with her. I didn’t want to go. I wanted to stay with A. She slept after the party and I intentially went late to the airport and missed my flight and came back to her. I am ashamed to say it but I was only happy at the thought of seeing A again . After about a month or so. I told A one night that I had begun to develop a really big crush on her and that we should talk about it. We did and we went to sleep. She wasn't feeling so well so I was caressing her head while we both slept. It was a very pure kinda thing. No one had any malice. I closed my eyes and sometime in the middle of the night She was all over me, I tried to stop her once but then just couldn't stop. It was done. Next morning she told me she couldn't control herself. We continued to fuck for the next three days with intervals while talking to no one. 

As time came for her to go, I just couldn't let her go, I don't why but I really felt all that gap that I had somehow crumpled with P to be filled with pure passion and lust for A. But I couldn't do it. A told me not to tell P. I did when she went. I told P and she almost came to the point of mental breakdown.

I became sure that  I couldn’t possible love P. I told her that we should break-up. Even after all that, P wanted us to stay together. She begged me. She did everything. I caved in. It’s been 5 months since that. My professional life seems to be dying an average death ( which I always feared and so thought not go to the average route by doing what my classmates were doing, study). My personal life is in shatters because I have crushed P’s confidence completely and her faith in humanity has died. I am mentally and physically exhausted by trying to stop thinking about A. I am trying not to think about her but I just can’t seem to do that. A has shun all contact with me. I have also tried to delete her memories but I still remember A’s contact number. All day I continue to think about her. I am possesed by her. I cannot leave P. I have already done so much harm to her. She would break I did leave her. I cannot be with A. Probably she thinks of me as a mistake and maybe there is no stable future with her. P has always been the kinda person I could think about long-term with. But the fact I, when I had sex with P, I was thinking about A in my mind. I don't even know what love is anymore. I know, I am FOOBAR and that’s why I am now continously thinking about dying. I want anyone to just help me out please. I am not a social person so I have literally no friends. ",suicide_watch,ID28304_suicide_watch,"

1545,"Seems like me falling apart really takes up speed. I've fallen oppressively silent.

Not that there would be anyone to talk to, I am actually utterly alone. But I did find some joy in talking to other people, here in this board or others, giving some advice or just lending an ear.

But even that's faded.

There has been no joy in my life since my wife left. Everything just reminds me of her, and the like three things that are left only serve as a tolerable way to kill time. It's nothing I enjoy. Just something I do and use.

I kept it together for full two weeks before falling apart. Now I'm just a bum and disgust myself. It's like I can watch going my graph ever further down. How I, at the beginning, still did this and that. Watch films. Play a game. Now I can't stand even these things anymore. Going for groceries has become so unbearable I'm rather eating stone-hard bread.

I'm in immeasurable pain. I did not think that much pain is possible. I am in agony every hour of every day, and it only gets worse. Even worse, there is nothing I want. There is nothing in my future worth working through all of this.

So I allow myself to be weak. It's comforting. At least once in my fucking life I'm using my right to be too tired to move on anymore.

I'm watching myself wasting away and it really feels like the dereliction and decay have taken up speed. I don't even want to sit here and write that shit. I just want to sleep, but I won't be able to until I get it out of my head.

My own wife doesn't give a flying fuck about me, why should I care.

Funnily enough, I really don't fit in with other suicidists. I'm not depressive, I got no mental illness. Nor are their any physical sicknesses. I'm not in chronic pain, my life, while a shitshow, didn't bring me down. I'm not helpless and know very well how do turn everything around if I wanted to.

I'm literally dying to a broken heart, the lack of reason to deal with it and the refusal of a future that holds nothing to me but vague, empty, meaningless promises.

It's a combination of lack of strength, affect and somber thought.

And I'll be so fucking relieved if I just check out and leave that mess behind.

If I'd known that I'm capable of feeling such pain and despair, I think I'd've killed me long ago.",suicide_watch,ID29149_suicide_watch,"

3761,Antidepressants- Nothing but numbing I have been on escitalopram 10 mg for a year and a half and it's messed me up. Don't feel happy or normal in any way. The only thing it does is totally numb me so I'm like a lifeless zombie. A shell of the person I was. I have no energy and when I go to counselling I can't even express my feelings properly cos I'm numb. I remember I first started it I felt it did work so I'm wondering if my body got used to it? I have no sex drive most of the time and always get sick when I drink alcohol so those are shit side effects too. If I miss a pill by mistake like I did on Saturday my emotions come back and I get extremely anxious tearful and suicidal to the point where I cant get out of bed but at least I can express what I'm actually feeling inside.

2832,"Does anyone else feel like two people? I read this allegedly true story about Edward Mordake, who had an extremely rare condition where he grew another face on the back of his head. 

He begged doctors to remove this face, and told them that the face would whisper things only said in Hell. And the face would always contract Edwards feelings: when Edward was happy, the face would be angry, and when Edward was sad, the face would laugh. As a result of this hellish existence, Edward Mordake committed suicide at the age of 23. 

Regardless of the credibility of this story, it gives an interesting perspective to living with these thoughts, and why we sometimes feel like we don't deserve to feel the way we do. 

I live in a nice and warm house, I have more than enough food, I get to do a lot of the things I enjoy. And in the end, I don't think life shits on me any more than other people. 

So there's me, the guy who is doing too well. And then there's the face on the back of my head who just wants me to carve out my wrists and jump in front of an incoming train.

2017,"This is the story that has taken me years to tell. Regardless of what many people think about me, or think they know about me I am still a person. I have made my mistakes, and made jokes out of those mistakes. I’ve never felt comfortable telling anyone or even talking about it without attempting to make it a joke. As I’ve gotten older, I see the serious toll this took on me. The emotional damage that has carried on through the years. When I was 17, I was raped. Not by one man, but by three. I took a trip to a large university with a girl from my high school to visit a friend. While there we were invited to drink, it was the party culture. It was the idea of doing something rebellious just to feel alive. After that night I no longer felt alive.  After that night I was no longer who I wanted to be. I was a girl going through the motions of daily life. To the girl I went with she always spoke about it as a funny story, a story in which she traded me for a bottle of alcohol. A story I never took seriously because of how she treated it, like a joke. After this night, I never felt like I could be touched without a small flashback of that night. I went through the motions, I tried so hard to feel something. Something I never felt again after that night. I turned to other things to try to feel something, a toxic relationship, more alcohol, drugs, random boys. I still felt nothing. That night a piece of me was taken that I will never get back. It was nights of miserable flashbacks, and trying to reach the bottom of the bottle, or going to party just to try to bring the spark back into my life. I never called it rape. It was, I didn’t know the names of these men. I didn’t consent, I just laid there. I let it happen, while my “friends” drank in another room. For most of the years I thought it was my fault, I thought because I was so drunk I had no right to call it what it truly was. I was a victim that night, and it took me two and a half years to realize this. For those years I couldn’t hold a healthy relationship, I was a bunch of rocky emotions mostly anger. A lost soul, I just needed to be found. I woke up one morning this past year and decided that I will no longer let that night define. This was not who I was supposed to be, I wasn’t meant to drop out of high school. I wasn’t meant to fall in love with someone who only broke me more. I was meant to live. I have worth, I have meaning, and I am a human. I still have trouble feeling certain emotions, but I am getting better. I woke up that day and decided to be better. I wanted to be a real friend, I wanted to be a lover, I wanted to be a fighter. I wanted to make a difference. I was ready to move on, I am not healed and I certainly am not a whole person nor do I think I ever will be. I made the choice to live that day. I decided to never take for granted the beautiful life I’ve been given. This is the secret I’ve carried for years now, and I’m ready. I’m ready to move on, I’m ready to live. Turning 21 I knew I had to find myself. I needed to be something worth being proud of. I made the choice to move on by myself. I can do this. I am victim, and being a victim will no longer define me. I am a creator, I am a lover, and I am a fighter. Here I am. ",off_my_chest,ID8227_off_my_chest,"

I'm tired of always conforming to what other peoples version of happiness is because i've never been happy that way. I've tried it. went to the gym almost every day for a year straight, got my grades up, even socialized with people and got a girlfriend, but in the end I just realized that I wasn't happy by my standards, I was happy by someone elses standards. It was fake happiness all along, so I dropped that lie of a life I was living and went back to doing the same shit I was doing before. playing video games and sleeping from sunrise to sundown and not giving a single fuck about life.

I realize now that maybe this is what happiness really is for me. Being a sad, lonely, antisocial person who has nothing to look forward to in life and just lives in the moment. I feel truly free. No obligations, and no putting up a fake mask just so everyone around me can see what a ""happy"" person I am. 

One of the bad  things now is I constantly have to put up with people's shit about how I'm depressed and need to go see a therapist or something. I know I'm depressed, but at least I am depressed in a way that I'm happy and comfortable with.

I'm using a throwaway account because I don't want any of what I'm about to say to be traced back to me. Admittedly, I'm a little drunk, but hey, I needed some liquid courage to get the words out, and I don't have anybody else to vent to except for you poor souls. I used to go to a therapist, but I ""got better"" last year, and stopped scheduling visits and weaned myself off Zoloft. Maybe I'll have to get in touch with the behavioral health hospital again...

Anyway, I'm a 22-year-old college senior. I made the mistake of majoring in chemistry. The job prospects are terrible. I'm graduating this December, and I'm terrified. I don't want to apply to chemistry graduate programs either because I've heard one too many horror stories about life as a PhD student, and I'm not trying to exacerbate my depression. 

So what am I going to do? Well, I guess I don't know. I'm currently a waiter at a struggling restaurant, so I suppose I'll have to work there after graduating. Not sure how that job will help me pay-off my student loans, though. I'll probably have to pick up a second, possibly a third job to keep my head above water.

On top of this, my girlfriend just got an engineering internship at a large corporation all because her mom is the head plastics engineer at one of their branch locations. Naturally, she thinks she's so fucking special now. Oh yeah, good fucking job, babe, you landed a job through nepotism. She thinks she's so smart even though I'm the one who has helped her with her math homework all these years. Of course, I could never say these things to her. What kind of guy would I be then? Best to just push all my jealousy and resentment deep, deep down into the darkness of my soul and act like I'm happy for her. That's why I took her out to a congratulatory dinner and lied through my teeth the whole time. Super healthy, I know.

Needless to say, I have no ambition right now. I'm usually a pro-active student, but this semester I've just been letting the world pass me by. Two of my professors have emailed me about my attendance, or lack thereof. Oh well. Maybe they'll lower my letter grade at the end of the semester in spite of my exam scores. Yeah, that'll teach me a lesson. 

All of my friends have moved away. (I was a year behind them in school.) They're all successful now. One is in law school. One is a journalist for a large publication company. One is in graduate school for geochemistry. One is a computer engineer. One is in pharmacy school. And then there's me, a soon-to-be career waiter. 

I should have majored in computer science or engineering. I might not be happier, but at least I'd be able to find a job that didn't entail serving over-priced burgers to rude, fat fucks. I've wasted so much time and money on this seemingly useless degree. I feel hopeless. Some nights I have to drink until I'm numb just so I can sleep, else intrusive thoughts will keep me up until morning. 

I'm sorry for rambling. I know I sound like a shitty person. I am one. I'm just so tired of living. I wish I didn't exist. I don't need a list of suicide hotline numbers to call. I've called them before. Thank you very much, though. 

Glad you took the time to read this. Or some of it. Or none of it. Thanks if you just clicked on it, I guess. I don't know. I'm pretty drunk now.

2335,"My girlfriend is leaving And no, this isn't a typical post where hitting the lawyer, deleting the gym, and facebooking up would solve the issue or should be recommended at all. It's also going to be long and I don't expect anyone to even read the whole thing. Just trying to get things off my chest.

I'm almost 30. My girlfriend and I met two and a half years ago and she's been the love of my life and my best friend ever since. She was also my first and only, as I was a depressed, kissless, socially inept virgin before then. Now I'm just depressed (and socially inept to a lesser degree). I don't believe that I will ever find someone as beautiful, smart, and funny as her. And do realize that I don't throw these terms around lightly. I'm not delusional in my assessment of her. She's also a great singer, has a wonderful family that fully embraced me and loved me possibly even more than she did. She encouraged me to become a better person, to learn to control my emotions better, to start exercising. She showed me the world through our travels together.

Despite the almost fairy tale life we had, I still had depression and went through depressive episodes on a fairly regular basis. I would shut her out, not eat or drink anything for a day or two, my sleeping schedule would go to shit. My mind would be absolutely filled with awful thoughts I could no longer control as I sat in the shower or laid in the darkest corner of our home that I could find. Throughout these 2.5 years I was convinced every now and then that she would eventually get fed up and leave, which contributed to my depression. She always reassured me that while it is difficult for her to see me in that state, she's not going anywhere. She is now.

Now allow me to elaborate on why this is an even bigger problem than a simple breakup, one of thousands that happened today. You see, somewhere along the line I also became distant with the only friend I had in the last 16 years. I severed that friendship on bad terms. I lost my amazing and well paying job 6 months ago due to depression and work related stress. Couldn't handle it anymore. Living off savings. Out of dozens of coworkers I knew well, was on *very* friendly terms with, and spoke with on a regular basis exactly **two** reached out to see how I was doing since I was laid off. Out of politeness. They disappeared shortly after. My mother has terminal cancer and will be gone within 6 months. My father is thousands of miles away in a different country with a different family. I don't maintain any sort of relationship with any other member of my small family, except perhaps for my younger sister whose mental health is just as fucked up as mine due to our wonderful inherited traits and a shitfest of a childhood.

Inb4 ""you should reach out to people more"" or ""make friends."" I'm essentially a high functioning aspie. Normal human relationships are a bit of an enigma to me. I'm not too sure why my gf stayed with me as long as she did. I suffer from severe social and generalized anxiety with panic attacks on top of depression and have other issues that make it difficult to get or maintain relationships (which is hopefully evident in the fact that I had exactly one friend and exactly one girlfriend in the last 16 years).

The point is, once my girlfriend is gone, I won't really have anyone else. At all. The thought of being completely and totally alone in a world that scared me since I was old enough to be scared of anything is incomprehensibly terrifying to me.

The funny thing is that my girlfriend isn't leaving because of any particular issue out of the ones mentioned above. We never really fought. Were always respectful of each other. We share plenty of interests. Our families are ecstatic that we're together. We have a great apartment and a huge fluffy cat. We have everything a couple could want, aside from mental stability in *both* partners. But at some point in the last 2.5 years she simply started losing romantic feelings for me. She saw me as someone I wasn't when we first started dating and the truth has slowly been dawning on her. She still loves me... yet only as a friend. This became apparent when she recently started talking with a person she met online, developed feelings for them, and realized she had more feelings for them than me. We still care about each other's well-being and want each other to be happy. Which is why it hurts so damn much.

I am not sure where life will take me from here. I am not sure I will want to go. I was thinking of simply moving to Nowhere, Alaska (or some other remote place) with what savings I have left, and drinking myself to death there, which seems like a more ethical suicide than actual suicide.

I had aspirations once. Even as recently as a couple months ago when I was going through (and finished) a coding bootcamp to stay in my former industry, but with better career prospects. On one hand, I still am perfectly capable of making good money and spending it to fill various holes in my life. On the other, I am not capable of leading a stressful life for long, nor do I want to, and working in the tech field is stressful no matter what. I'm also not sure what the point would be. It's essentially a slower death than the drinking to death route, except I'd die of a heart attack or aneurysm and it would take longer.

And now we get to the self-blame part. 3 years ago (pretty much right before I met my girlfriend) I suffered a major breakdown due to stress at work. Took some time off work to try different therapies and medications to help me cope with life. I got on a highly effective, highly addictive, well-known benzodiazepine and made a decision to buy myself time to see what life is really like. Before that I didn't have much, except my job and that one friend. With anxiety mostly out of the way due to the medication I was able to trick life and start dating. I could travel and be more productive at work. I socialized more. I enjoyed life. For a time. That time is up. The medication isn't as effective anymore, its side effects are more pronounced. Anxiety and depression are back in full force. I cannot handle work stress anymore. Social contact is difficult again. This is what bugs me: I was completely aware that this would happen, that I would experience life for a couple precious years before it would be taken away from me, and I did it anyway. I knew it would hurt when I lost it all again and it sure does. I *thought* it would be worth it. Now I'm not sure that it was.

As far as I'm concerned, when I was suicidal and about to jump out our high rise apartment window when I was just 11 years old (so 19 years ago), when my own mother said ""go on, jump you little shit,"" I should have listened to her and saved myself the trouble of seeing what a normal, happy life can be like for a few brief moments before it all fades back to blackness again.",depression,ID4582_depression,"

910,"""I wish things could go back to the way they were"" You know I've been through some tough time but this one takes the cake. I know I didn't seem like I cared at first, and to be frank, I didn't. We both agreed we'd been screwed over too many times to want anything serious. It was fun, messing around here and but never getting too into things. Then valentines day came around and I made the mistake of asking you out.

 We got to see Ryan Reynolds ass violated on the IMAX screen (Deadpool movie) and laughed so hard together that we got looks form around the theater. I took you to my favorite bistro that I had never shared with anyone else, I bought you the twitch doll that you never would let leave your side in bed, I kissed you and told you I wanted to be more than just friends.

So began our year of fun. I showed you that our shitty home town wasn't the only place in the world, I can't even count the amount of adventures we went on. I took you to your first EDM concert (life in color) you said it was an experience you would never forget. I took you to cedar point every weekend because it's one of my favorite places I've ever been. I took you to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to show you the music and the bands you loved in person not over headphones.

When I told you I got accepted to college upstate you were so proud of me, but I could see the pain in your eyes. I told you I would cancel to stay by you since you couldn't leave your college in our hometown, but you insisted I chase my dreams and we would make it work. 

I remember how you suggested we go to cedar point one more time before I left since we probably wouldn't have the time or money. That was such a fun week, we saved for months just to afford it. We got a room at Hotel Breakers, right on the beach. Every day riding rides, walking on the beach, or relaxing in the hot tub. I even managed to get you to face your fears and come parasailing with me.

It was that night after parasailing that at dinner I tried to describe to you how I felt. After 10 minutes of trying to say I love you in a way that makes sense you just looked at me and told me that Emotional detachment disorder or not you knew I loved you and you loved me.

Finally it came time for me to leave for college. Every night we would skype. It didn't matter if it was to talk, play league of legends together, or sit quietly and do homework/papers together. I texted you every morning, after every class, just every chance i got, and you did the same. One of us would come to the other every free weekend we got.

That first semester was fun, but without you it just didn't make me happy. When I told you switched entirely online classes and moved up here with me. When we moved in I was ecstatic, sure I had to take on a fast food job that i hated with my classes but it was worth it to have you next to me every night. I bought you a brand new gaming PC to celebrate so you could finally try playing other game than league with me just like you wanted. But I guess that when everything started going downhill.

You found a job up here that overworked you to the extreme, no one should work 45-50 hours a week and go to school full time. I did my best to help you on homework whenever I was off and done with my own. But your grades were slipping still. I started ignoring my own school work to help you and finally your grades stabilized. But still you were stressed and tired 24/7... So without telling you I dropped out and got a 2nd factory job to raise more money.

With the bank account always filled with surplus you finally quit and found yourself a part time job at a pet shop up north a bit and were so happy. Your grades improved drastically, you were always happy and because of that so was I. But I was always tired from the work, and from what you say you took this on as unhappiness with you. You started  getting sad again and in turn so did I.

At last I found a good paying sales manager job and was able to quit both the shitty ones and keep us stable as you liked it. Your birthday rolled around and I made a candle lit dinner with baked salmon, and your favorite flowers all ready for when you got home. I put on my suit and when you walked in the door I threw the new dress I bought you at you and had you go put it on. When oyu got downstairs I turned on stand by me (Florence and the machine cover because shes an angel) and we danced before we ate.

Fast forward to the summer, you got full time at your store. I was so proud of you. We  drove to Michigan just to celebrate at the nearest Joe's Crab Shack. It sucked a bit, you were no longer home when I came back on lunch breaks. I always closed and you always opened so we couldn't ever really do anything. But at least we could play games, watch movies, and be together. This is about when I bought the ring and waited for the right time.

Then you started being home less and less, coming home later and later. Texts were a rare pleasure. Suddenly you were apparently working 12+ hour days, sometimes having to stay at a ""Friends"" since you closed and then had to open even though you were only 35 minutes away . I started drinking without you there and whenever you came home to me drunk you didn't like it at all. It was when I was pouring a glass when you came in and told me you hated how much I started to drink. I knocked the glass into the sink and poured the brand new bottle I had opened right down the drain in front of you. I didn't drink for 3 months after that.

We stopped having sex and I didn't mention it for months. Finally I couldn't handle it and I asked why, you told me you no longer found me attractive like that. I didn't blame you, I had gained 60 pounds since college, so I started working out.

Nothing changed though, you still were rarely home... Then one night you brought HIM home, the *just a friend*. We met we played games, it was whatever. But I noticed when he went to leave you walked him to his car, something you have never done for any of your other friends. 

I got crazy, I went through your phone, I saw everything. All the I love you's, miss you's, all the things we used to have. The next time you said you wouldn't be home that night I decided to follow where you went from work. Sure enough it was with the * just a friend*. I texted you I hate you, you called, I screamed. The next day you showed up to move out. 

After showing the ring, you admitted to cheating. After talking you decided to apologize for everything and stay. We said we'd make it work, just like we did before. You said you'd be home every night, just like before. But you didn't, and we didn't. You continued to talk to him, you couldn't make it to the concert I wanted to go to for my birthday but you straight up bought tickets to go with him to the one he wanted to go see for his. You still only came home once every one to two weeks, but you started to fuck me again (I wonder if he knows, Hey dipothedino or whatever your screen name is, if you see this know your ""gf"" is still fucking her ex).



I knew why, but I didn't care. It was cheaper and easier to keep staying with him and stay on our lease than anything else. I was still so head over heels in love with you I just wanted you to kiss me and say you loved me. I asked you to be home for sweetest day and you said ok. I completely recreated the birthday dinner I had made for you and patiently waited. 10pm hit, you should be here in a half hour... 10:30... 11... 12.... Finally you call to tell me you won't be making it. I threw the flowers out the back drank my night away.

It was just a few nights ago that you showed up wit hflowers and a happy anniversary card. That night we were  and you said, ""I wish things could go back to the way they were, I miss our little family.""  

Really, you miss it? How do you think I feel. I'm the one in the bed I bought for us alone every night wondering if this will be the night you actually come home. I'm the one who invested his future completely in you only for this. And that when it clicked, I finally lost all feeling for you.

If you actually missed how things were, you would change. After all, that's the only thing that is different. You. Your bed is still here, your computer, the man you used to love. The only thing missing is you. And so I told you as soon as the lease was up I was cutting you out. You were surprised, hurt even, since I'm at least friendly with all my other ex's, but I refuse to be treated this way. I am better than this, I deserve better than this. I will not allow myself to continue to be manipulated. I gave you everything I had to offer, I did my best and it was not enough. So I don't hate and I don't love you. You're just a stranger at this point. But all the same I'm stuck here saying...

5358,"I'm starting to really fucking hate my mother. I don't know if it's just come about recently or I've only just realised now. I really hate her. I wish I didn't but I can't stop my feelings. She's fed me, housed me, made sure I was safe but I feel like that's all been because she's had to legally. I'm bisexual and she hates that. She ganged up on me with my gran telling me how wrong it is (my gran doesn't know I'm bi though so this made it hurt even more since she probably saw it as some sort of sick opportunity) laughing and looking me in the eye through it all as well as acting like I'm just bisexual to annoy her.

When I opened up about my depression to her she just denied it despite me being in a really bad place and showing it (screaming, staying in my room all day, not talking etc.). She's a stuck up fucking bitch who only cares about her public image. She's spent money on me but I can't remember the last time I felt genuine love from her or she did something that showed that. It seems like she just gives me money so I don't bother her. 

She's also a liar. My friend doesn't want to come around my house anymore because my mum stalked her on instagram and then blocked her when my friend found out. When I told her and my stepdad she didn't want to come round anymore my mum kept completely silent the whole time. I was depressed already but she's not helping. I've thought about leaving her once I can and it's really appealing but I don't know.

655,"tempted to give up it's come to my attention recently that honestly, no one gives a flying fuck about me. i could get wiped off the face of the earth in the next minute and no one would really give a shit. 

my parents don't really believe in mental health issues, they took me to a therapist for a short while before deciding that it was a waste of money and i've been cold turkey w/o therapy since. tried to convince my dad to give it back to me, he said he would for months before finally blowing up at me today and saying how much of a waste it is and that ""if anything, i deserve therapy for dealing with your ass"". (oh, regardless of these facts, my mom emotionally abuses me and my dad physically abuses me, so, there's that too.) 

i'm decently popular, but my irl friends aren't really ""friends"", we just talk a lot about pointless things - and god forbid emotions get real (well, exclusively with me - on the other hand, they have no issues comforting their other, ""real"" friends). i live in a country where you can't really talk about mental health shit either. i was closest to my internet friends, but they've all gone awol now for one reason or another and i'm pretty much alone. 

the only thing keeping me going are my dreams - i'm working towards being a coder, as well as a musician and actress, but even then i sometimes wonder if i want those dreams just so i can get recognised and they're just an extended cry for help lmao. as much as i am ambitious and hardworking, it's killing me to not be able to talk to anyone at all. 

TL;DR: no friends, family dgaf, constantly teetering on the brink of suicide but never quite there... is it time to give up already?

1438,"How to approach getting therapy I'm considering therapy. I've never like talking about my personal life unless with someone I trust, but I'm at a point in time where all my friends have slowly drifted away from me and the ones who are close don't care or won’t listen. I attempted to let off some steam to online friends and it did somewhat comfort me but it wasn’t what I was looking for exactly. I have so much I want to get off my chest but I want to see the person listening and see they can at least hear what I’m saying. I know I will be uncomfortable with it but I’m willing to give it a try to hopefully stop any sort of depression from coming back.

The only problem is my parents, my dad tries to solve all my problems like they’re his and that will require talking to him which I have never really been comfortable with. My mom on the other hand is the real issue. She tries to get up on my business all the time, hates it when I ‘act’ sad or look angry when it’s my normal resting face and has given my emotional abuse most to all my life. I’m not getting therapy for the emotional abuse as I’ve adapted ways to cope with it, but the extra abuse certainly doesn’t help with the stress I feel at school. My mom has tried to force me into therapy a couple of times all for the wrong reasons and without my consent.

How do I approach my parents with even the idea of receiving therapy? I’m not close to them as well so I don’t know them well enough to know how they’ll react. Any help, advice or even stories of what you’ve experienced is appreciated.

It’s weird because my laziness/procrastination is ruining my life but I never seem to have the willpower to do anything about it. It’s gotten so bad that I tried but failed to kill myself a few weeks ago. There was a really important 4000 word research essay that I had to submit within 2 days, that I haven’t even touched.

932,"The Rational Ending I've been attempting to make a comeback for years, but I'm not even sure what I'd come back to. I was willfully carefree in my 20's, unencumbered by debt or ambition, traveling a bunch, not having much money or caring about much. The world was interesting. 

But of course, I was doing that when other, more responsible people were creating a solid foundation on which to have a life beyond youth: getting married, developing a career, etc. I can just imagine how satisfying it is for them now to see that I'm broke and alone at 45. I'm a victim of my own irresponsibility. 

I've tried a few times to become a contributing member of society; I went back to school at 35, but didn't finish the degree - still have the debt though, which I can't imagine ever being free of at this point. I always did well on tests and made good first impressions, but have been a consistent disappointment to myself and everybody else. 

A few people have suggested over the years that I had ADD, so this year I was desperate enough to try meds. But that seems to have resulted only in a short period (a couple weeks) of frantic activity that was, in retrospect, a parody of productivity. At that time, I also lost the crappy boring job that was keeping me alive, and have not been able to secure another one. It's also when it started to make sense to think about how to make an exit.

Increasingly, the only people who seem convinced that I can possibly do anything for them are debt collectors, and they are very persistent, but very wrong. It's becoming too painful to keep feebly attempting to make some kind - and kind - of positive contribution. I'm at the age where my mental and physical abilities are noticeably deteriorating, and I never had much drive or ambition, even when I was younger and sharper. So my options are to spend the next however many decades being more and more miserable and taking up space and resources, or to make a graceful exit. I resolved to pursue the latter course yesterday, but couldn't go through with it. Fear and the momentary will to live are stronger than I would have thought they'd be. It seems inevitable though now, especially since I'm in a lot of the top categories that don't involve substance abuse or serious mental illness: unemployed, LGBT (specifically ""B"", which tends to be the most miserable, according to some stats) white guy, between 45 and 59, never married, unstable childhood and adolescence, not religious, living alone.

I think it's a rational choice to end it all when you're reasonably convinced that you have nothing to look forward to but trauma, stress, and alienation. I've been trying for years in lots of ways to find a place in the world and I think there just isn't one. The trajectory I'm on is one in which the anxiety of being alive is taking over all of the moments in my life, making it impossible to enjoy anything.",suicide_watch,ID29372_suicide_watch,"

2800,"Relative recently made an attempt During Thanksgiving I was told that one of my cousins (early twenties) had just been in the hospital after overdosing on a large amount of painkillers. But the people who pulled me aside to tell me about it all said that it was an drunken accident.  I did not believe them and so I messaged her about how I've struggled with depression and I'm here if they need anyone to talk to.  I also said that I saw a doctor and therapist in college and found an antidepressant that's helped me out and that if they wanted to find someone to talk to or had any questions that I could help.

They responded and didn't really confirm that it was a suicide attempt but didn't deny the implication either, and said that it meant a lot to them and that they had been considering talking to a doctor and maybe trying medication again, and that they would message me if they want help with anything.

Is there anything else I should say/do? We are not very close, my family usually only sees and talks to each other at holiday gatherings.  So I feel like if I start texting her then she will feel like I am trying to keep an eye on her and be annoyed. 

Also, I am confused about the situation because the rest of my relatives tried to tell me it was an accident, but I am not sure if they actually believe that. Her father didn't seem to act any different, and asked me to drive my cousin to her apartment afterward which I found odd because I would think that if he knew she was suicidal then he would have wanted to have more time to talk to her and make sure she was okay and got home alright. Or would have wanted her to stay with relatives or something so that she wasn't alone. I am unsure if I should talk to them and let them know that I think it was a suicide attempt, or if they already know and are trying to hide it?

If anyone has any advice please post. I don't really have any experience in this situation.  I read the talking tips and assessment guide on the right, but since we aren't close I'm unsure if trying to talk to her more would be good or not.",suicide_watch,ID34655_suicide_watch,"

4489,"Need help (advice) desperately I first started taking antidepressants like 3 years ago, but on very short periods, rarely. Than I wasn't taking for some time and everything was ok (note, while I made pauses previously I had those withdrawal effects for like a day or two).

So one year ago I started actively taking antidepressants everyday and increasing dosage. But they never help, they only make me more numb. I told my therapist that I want to stop them, and he told me to cut them in a few days, little by little. But ever since then (~3 months) I've had ultra bad withdrawal symptoms: weird brain zaps, headache, nausea, diarrhea etc. The headache (plus a feeling of weakness, constant sleepyness, and feeling like something is eating my brain - the headache) is the most painful, and the thing is that it's constant, 24/7. At this point I just want to know that it would stop, ever, in few weeks the most preferably. I really don't have time for this, I have other issues (obviously, that's why I started taking meds), plus I'm currently at college.

Before writing this I searched this sub for ""withdrawal"" and that exactly what I have. I just want to know estimation, (considering I took high dosage for months), and whether I should start taking some dosage again and then cut it little by little and in the end completely.

Really, the doctors are fags, they all tell me antidepressants are 0% addictive and they don't affect the brain, when obviously it's not true (I mean, I've experienced it myself, how can someone even try to deceive me...). And by the way my parents are 0% supportive, my mother tells me that withdrawal crisis from any substance last few days max and that I make this up inside my head (thus, running away from the issue), and my father keeps telling me that I shouldn't have started taking them at all (thus, also running away from the issue).

4116,"I studied for 6 years and then I fucked up my first job. I have always been told how gifted I was and school was a breeze. I never had to study really hard to get good grades and I graduated with the 7th best grades of my year. Then came the time to decide what to do with my life. How do you know at 18 what you are going to be? But I had my convictions, I wanted to do something that would help society and on my moral compass and due to my life experiences this was biomedial science, I wanted to help heal diseases, I wanted to be a scientist.


So I went off to uni and after some difficulties in the beginning I figured out how to study properly and did not too bad. I did my B.Ss. and decided to do an M.Sc. in my chosen little subfield of my field. And again I did great. I studied my ass off. I would have 60h weeks. Then I got the chance to go abroad for an internship and a graduation project. So I did. It was a hard year but I did it.


This is where the problems started. I couldn't get better at the technical side of science. I just had so many problems. I would mix up samples and fuck up way too many experiments.
Also, in the 5 years prior I developed really bad anxiety around my degree, so that I would panic a lot around my work. 
But with the year abroad I was able to get an intership in the biggest company in my field. I was over the moon. This is what I wanted to be all these years ago. a researcher. And I fucked it up. 

I have been there for a month and I fucked up something very important which other people invested hours and hours of work into. My boss was devastated. I was devastated. She is saying to me I am not trying and don't seem motivated. I don't know why this keeps happening. I'm trying to concentrate but I just cant and keep making stupid mistakes. I don't know if she is going to throw me out on monday. I feel like i wasted 6 year. I feel like shit for fucking up other peoples work, I hate myself for this. I don't what I am going to do now. It's not like there are jobs being thrown at you with my degree. But I dont feel like I can work in my field as a scientist.  I still need to finish this internship (or get thrown out or whatever she is going to do with me), pass one exam and hand in my thesis. And then what?

I fucked up my Life. I once thought I was some kind of shining bright Star on the Horizon of Life and its endless possibilities and my Dreams were so big and felt so real and reachable at the time.
Now I am sitting here, 25 Years old - still a Student but there is no way I can finish it with the problems I have. And ffs how boring can a topic be. Fuck Electrotechnic.
To cut it short: I just feel like shit. Physically, I am weak and Ill, mentally I am broken. I am ugly. I have no self confidence. I have a weird voice. I look weird. I have big teeth. My Eyes are narrow. I am the personification of weird.

The sad thing is, I will never reach out to help because I just don't do that. A quote in a television show summarizes my feelings quite well: ""What do normal people do if they feel sad - They reach out to friends or family. That's not an option, I do morphine.""

I can relate to the quote quite well because my parents just don't understand mental health, my friend is at least as fucked as I am and I we do downers and cocaine to cope. At least high we feel SOMETHING.
I am working online, quite successful, that means I leave the house only once a weak to buy grocery. I developed back all my Social Skills that I learned from age 12 to 22. I had an exciting life, I have been to America, Canada, Backpacking in Sweden, passionate about the climbing sport, but it's all lost. Had a lot of friends, but fuck them. My Girlfriend with 18? Obviously not worth it, because it fucked the next possible thing available with no regrets.
Why would I need annoying people in my life? I am a loner and that is the way it is. You can't go against nature.
I don't even know how to hold a normal conversation anymore. It is obvious I need help, I am ticking time bomb. I am not able to kill myself because that would destroy my family, this is not an option. So do not worry about that shit, I am way to arrogant to kill myself. 
I am obviously high writing this, which is, of course, a piece of shit paper because I have absolutely zero talents, but I thought for a while I am quite good at writing, turns out I'm shit. Shit, like the whole mass of my disgusting body.
I am 25 and I have no chance of fixing my Life. Isn't that tragic? I picked the wrong major and now I am stuck in it. I am to old to change and restart. I am interested in IT, but I am probably to scared to apply for it at the end of the year.
I just fucking hate myself. Where did it all go so downhill from? What in the fucking hell happened?

3921,"I'm starting to feel like I deserve this. I've been a victim of abuse all my life. Be it verbal, physical, sexual I've experienced it all. Its made me drop out of high school and finish in a continuation school. I'm also giving it my 3rd attempt at university now.

I moved states to get away from my toxic family to be with someone I thought cared for me. I have no friends or family in this new state (and have a hard time making them, I'm anti-social/introvert, the average median age at my work is 55-65 and I'm in my 20s, and my school is online), I am 3000 miles away from 'home', and the relationship I foolishly came here for has now turned sour and physically abusive.

I live in hawaii now and could never afford to live on my own or even with a roommate(s) so I just endure this pain and cover up bruises with make up while I try to make something of my life so I can survive on my own. But it's getting hard.

I think very logically and know I'm dumb for keeping myself in this toxic environment, but when you have no where else to go or no one else to turn to you just kind of deal and keep your mouth shut while hoping for the best. Talking doesnt help.

This weekend has taken a toll on me. Maybe it's a combination of the shitty relationship and the lonely holidays, but I'm starting to think about my life and coming to a conclusion maybe somewhere down the line or in a past life I did something to deserve this. And this is my punishment. 

Every time someone hurts me I find myself doing something nice for someone else. Not because I expect kindness in return but maybe because I don't know how to be kind to myself.

I don't know what to do anymore. All I do is cry. I'm not even sure why I'm writing this. I don't want help. I just need to vent.",depression,ID33968_depression,"

4998,"I’ve given up on this life Hi, this is my first time posting on this site (I made this account specifically for this post). I don’t know why I’m posting this, maybe just to tell my story. 
I’m a 24 male and suffered with depression since I was about 10. Throughout my shitty life I’ve been bullied, over weight, and abandoned (I know sounds like a generic teenage loser film lol). I was suffering through my depression alone until I was 22 and I never told a soul about my plans of suicide until that year. I told my father first and I expected some kind of shock or worrying reaction. What I got was him telling me “ get a job” and ignoring me for the next 3 months until I left to go live with my mother. A little background on my father; when my mother got pregnant with me, he came out of the closet as gay and left her. Since then he has only used me and my fragile state for his own benefit while mocking and berating me in private. I don’t want you all to get the wrong idea, I don’t hold any resentment towards him for leaving but what he told me was the last straw of a long line of issues. I no longer talk to him and I don’t regret it. 
I later told my mother who sent me to see a psychiatrist the next day. I was diagnosed with depression (shocking I know) and was prescribed medication and therapy. I also went to a support group where the teach how to act in normal society. 
Throughout this entire process, I’ve lost most of my family, my friends who I made in college stopped talking to me, including my “best friend”. People who I thought would support me are now gone and I have no one. I haven’t been accepted to any job that I’ve applied to, part time included, and I’m running out of places to apply. My degree is useless and I’m broke. My mother is still supporting me and keeps telling me how much I have to give. Her saying that is just making me worse. I’ve been told that all my life. School came easy to me( I don’t mean to sound entitled or anything) and I was treated as an outcast because I wasn’t allowed to move up to more advanced classes so I was treated like shit by almost all my classmates in high school. 
I internalized this into college so I never went to class and never took any internships or had any serious clubs. ( IF YOU READ ANYTHING IN HEAR READ THIS.  DONT YOU WHO ARE YOUNGER THAN ME MAKE THIS MISTAKE LIKE I DID) If you want to be successful you need these and I just thought they were useless things and another reason to be made fun of. After 6 years ( there was an issue where my abroad credit didn’t transfer) I managed to graduate with a 3.0. ( I also retook a couple classes I failed so the grade replaced the failing grade). 
I’ve lived my life thinking things would get better but I’m just toxic. I’ve somehow pushed away anyone who I thought cared about me ( including a girl I thought I loved). The only people I have left are my mother, little brother and sister (who resents me for “abandoning” my father). The world is just full of people who don’t care, are sadistic and there’s no hope for someone like me. Yesterday I had an argument with my stepfather and he told me how useless I was and how much of a waste of money and space I was. I told him I was going to kill myself to relieve everyone and he told me just not to do it in the house. I left to go I don’t know where and ended up driving 100 miles away. The entire time I was considering how to kill myself without pain. My mother called me, concerned for me, and I decided not to do it that day. When I later told her what happened, she was upset but was defending my stepfather. I just don’t know anymore. I don’t think I want to die but I don’t want to exist in this world. My dreams are gone and have dwindled down to winning the lottery and moving to the woods to be left alone. There’s no hope for that though so I don’t know what else to do. Anyway thanks for reading if you made it this far. ",suicide_watch,ID34782_suicide_watch,"

221,"What to do when someone won't admit they have an anxiety problem My father has several severe mental health issues but absolutely refuses to get treatment for any of them. He'll call my apartment all day when I'm at work leaving messages and also calls my mobile phone incessantly. I answer a few times per day at work, but for the most part, I have to keep it silent. 

The calls don't stop when I get home, always with the purpose of wanting to make sure I'm ""all right."" He keeps this going well into the night and I can't get any sleep. If I don't answer disconnect the landline, he'll show up and start pounding on the door. I've tried telling him he needs to stop doing this, but he thinks it's perfectly normal and acceptable behavior.

To put this in context, he also thinks he's a prophet who was foretold in the bible, believes every dream he has is a message from God, says he single-handedly stopped the 9/11 attacks and so on. When anyone tells him he has anxiety issues and needs help, he gets furious and sometimes violently so. 

He's stubborn to the point that he's literally touched scalding items solely because he was told not to in order to avoid a burn. I've tried the reverse psychology approach, but that hasn't worked either.

I don't have anyone. I can never find a boyfriend.  I don't have friends. I have colleagues from school or work but not friends. I have been moving from place to place all my life. I don't have a lot of money. I have been seeing the psychiatrist for depression. Something is wrong with me in not like everyone else. I can't understand people.  Most of then make me angry and I just cut my relations with them. I'm scared I'm a psycho.  I'm crazy I do a lot of random stuff and dangerous things that put my person at risk. I don't think I'm scared of anything. People think I'm crazy for doing things I do. I'm so lonely.  I don't know what to do with my life and if my life has any point?  It's a misery for me.  Nobody likes me. I don't think I'm friendly. I say what I think and I say what I want because I don't see how I can not speak up and pretend a lot of things. Pretending makes me angry. I have been in deep shit before and came out of this but every time I'm putting myself together my life just starts falling to crap again. I'm tired of getting up and just fighting and pretending I'm all okay and fine and everything is just ok. I feel I have to be someone I'm not so other people like and respect me. Nobody wants me.

2550,"I think that reading online news may be severely affecting my depression. Have you tried cutting it, and has it helped you? I've been thinking over the past week and it seems that my habit of reading online news (and checking related web sites) may explain why my depression is much worse now than in years past despite similar failures and stress and work loads, in some of the following potential ways:

* most obviously, the content itself makes me angry or sad, or worries me;
* I feel the need to have a cogent opinion on current events and when I don't have a strong, eloquently-worded argument ready I imagine myself getting humiliated, or I tell myself that ""[I'm] stupid and should really just go kill [my]self"";
* especially with the recent sexual misconduct revelations I worry, even though I have never committed sexual assault, that I'm a pervert in some more subtle, unknown way and it's only a matter of time before I say the wrong thing and everyone finds out (I also have obsessive-compulsive disorder);
* more generally, with all the recent op-eds about subtle -isms (which I *do* think make good points), I feel like I'm in a constant verbal minefield in which I'm in perpetual danger of saying the wrong thing;
* sometimes I feel like I even lose touch with reality: for example I'll read an article and mentally say incendiary things that don't reflect my true feelings (ex: ""thank god that [bad thing in news] happened"")

(*Wow.*  Typing that list opened my eyes, even as it was therapeutic.)  

I'm going to try cutting out news for a while, but has anyone experienced similar symptoms?  I can't imagine I'm the only one, especially with the toxicity of the Internet and general cultural climate nowadays.

259,"Don't know what to do. 30s female here. Not able to travel far so i can't do dying with dignity. I'm very ill. Like 2 steps away from needing life support. To live I'd need a double lung transplant,  but i won't survive the procecure. Can't walk,  can't move my body,  can only move fingertips. The worst part is that i can't leave the house,  can't swallow food, can't even go in a wheelchair.  Can't sleep. If i fall asleep i stop breathing and need cpr. Pls no medical advice bc i know my situation and all angles have been converted.  Cpap won't work,  not oxygen.  My lungs are weak and similar to ALS end stage.  Every breath is a chore and i know I'm dying soon. Pls don't talk religion either bc I'm too a level of suffering beyond comprehension. 
Barely any family support. I want to hang it up.  I can't take the physical agony anymore.  Every millisecond is agony at 10/10. There's never a second of relief. I can barely post this but I'm going thru torture bc im likely ending it anyway.  I have nothing to live for. No life.  Confines to same chair in living room for years.  No social support except online.  No ability to do hobbies...too symptomatic.  Can't even watch tv.
If i were a dog they'd euthanize me. 
Ideally I'd use a gun. I have no way to get one on the black market.  In fact,  i want to get one for when it gets unbearable and i think I'm in my final stroke. I had 4 already but since I'm late stage the next stroke will likely kill. I need feeding tube and ventilator to survive more than 2 more wks. A dr said the way my throat etc are the vent won't take.  
And frankly even with a vent it won't help much bc there's barely room for air in there.  I'm in respiratory distress 24/7.
If i keep a gun handy i can use it as last resort.  I don't want to buy a gun and just end my life.  No.  I want to use it at a moment where I'm dying and i can't escape. I'm basically dying now but it's slower. I'll prob know when my lungs are at 5%. Right now they're at about 8% function.... worse than having cf, copd, etc....
I need this torture to end.  This is NOT humane to live this way!  If you think it's selfish for me to end it,  well i think it's sunfish for ppl to want me to stick around for their company while I'm in upmost torture. Not to mention I'm a burden. They all know I'm dying anyway.  You're probably wondering why I want to end it if I'm just going to die soon anyway. Well that's a good question. I have been fighting this for so many years and it's a slow digression but now obviously I know that I am dying pretty soon. I do kind of want to just stick it out and let it happen naturally. But I think I have reached my Max. And like I said I'm not going to end this abruptly. I would only use it as a last resort. Ideally I would like to just passed peacefully in my sleep. But I would like to go on in case it gets to the point where it is just absolutely necessary that I would do anything to get out of that moment.",suicide_watch,ID20935_suicide_watch,"

I'm a third year student in college and have never been so stressed with school and life in general. This semester ends in a little over a month and I still have nearly 40 pages worth of papers, a mountain of assignments, 2 presentations, and 2 exams. 

My mom also broke her ankle a week and a half ago and she got a few plates and some screws in her ankle. She's not going to be able to get around for quite some time (at least 3 months) as she is not in the physical shape to properly use crutches for any more than 2 minutes at a time. It kills me to see her like this. 

I have been trying to find balance but every time I think about the tasks I still need to complete I feel my heart drop and I want nothing more than for it to just end. I have slept for about a total of 10 hours in the past week and have trouble staying asleep in the times that I do get some rest. Every time I think about school, I have trouble breathing and I get cold. It is also hard to put on a face that does not worry my mom. The last thing I want is for her to worry about me and for her to see the mental state that I am in. 

Sorry if this was a mess and difficult to read, I just can't think straight right now. ",anxiety,ID33901_anxiety,"

I feel like a failure yet again. I flunked out of university, I failed at sustaining any employment that could provide my needs. I've felt like a leech to my parents for the past 4 years which has made me feel awfully guilty. My parents have recently suggested I pursue ODSP. Now I need help from taxpayers and I have absolutely no idea when I will be able to ever function again to contribute myself.

It is always tough to ever feel like my recovery is ""worth it""; especially when it seems that I am getting worse and not better. Although, I am getting much more self-aware of this illness' ebbs and flows.

I want to rush through my recovery so desperately. I hate feeling so hopeless and being tortured by it, I'm sure we all do; I certainly want it to end. I have been learning, albeit the hard way, specifically in the last year. **Recovery from major depression is a marathon, not a sprint.**

4798,"20 year old loser I just want to start of saying that I understand my age and theres so much time ahead of me, but if I don't get this figured out, it's gonna fuck me up in the long run. 
Alright, so basically, I hate myself, my habits, and my brain. I'll just give you a brief rundown of my life. I'm 20 years old and work a job with a bunch of drug addicts and another job in the food service.There is  other random jobs I do helping doing construction, demo etc. I did not go to college and don't plan on it either. I'm really dumb and have short term memory loss and don't want to end up in the rat race because a rash decision I made going into a field I won't like. I also live at home still in a suburb with my broke family. It's my mom grandma and other siblings. My dad was an abusive drinker and drug user and came in and out of our lives growing up while we moved apartment to apartment not paying rent. That's no excuse for where I'm at btw I know people have had it way worse and still end up on top. I also didn't start working until I was 18 and I'm just realizing how much I hate myself for ever asking my mom for shoes or putting me in sports or going out with my friends when I was younger. I always thought we were okay because we lived around other people who were okay, if I could go back I'd be working full time as a 14 year old. Alright so my background is finished basically. Now lets get into my head. I've always been a weird kid looking back. I didn't talk much at all, it used to be shyness but now I just don't like talking to people, I had a few close friends and that was it, no other socializing was sought after. This lead to me never talking to girls, which lead to me having no confidence or self esteem when I really want to, like now. I'm emotionally unstable because I hate the position I'm in and that just stacks onto my lack of confidence because who the hell wants to talk with a guy who's emotionally weak, some might lie and say they will but they'll bang your buddy who's got everything going for them in the blink of an eye. I've seen it first hand with my friend. Ill let that be a segway. Jealousy and envy. My friend is extremely successful. Sure his whole family is also and that is to be expected but it still messes with me because how much better he is than me. It makes me wanna cry like the little bitc I am. He started working for his dads company when he was 16, I didn't find that out till recently btw, and his success was well deserved and well earned. It just sucks that theres nothing I can do to get that time back, he knows that it messes with my head to, Ill always be a few steps behind him and he rubs it in like Im his son you know. This is a guy that has more money than majority of people in their 30s and gets laid like a pronstar. And then theres me, the broke loser virgin who got himself into a terrible situation because he had no drive or brain to think about his future. I don't even know why I'm typing this shit tbh. I just hate myself for who I am and am jealous af of my friends. In retrospect I am just being a whiny bich. I don't know what I want from this, maybe another it's gonna be alright hug and a good luck. All I know is I gotta do something, and let me tell ya. Seeing successful people who didn't need school makes me want to do something without it too. I could easily learn a trade move out hit the gym get my own place and just start talking to people and be happy. But that wouldn't make me happy, because I dont give a fuck about me. All I want to do is find a way to get rich so I can give my family everything they've ever wanted. I want my grandma to die knowing that her family is gonna be okay and not be stuck struggling their whole lives. If I could do that, I could die the next day with a smile. I just want to hear some other opinions on my life other than my own, therapy ended up being bull ish and a waste of money and telling my family that I hate myself ended up making me feel worse because they said what they're going through. If anyone reads this, thank you. I just want someone to read this. ",depression,ID9175_depression,"

3513,"I never know where to start, or even what to ask on here....there are so many ways that anxiety, depression, etc etc etc torture me, and I seem to lack the language or ability to talk about ""it"" in a way that makes me feel like I've captured ""it"" e.g- every day I wake up and a handful of terrible fears and regrets that I can't just ""let go"" (considering some of them are tattoos I regret and can't afford to get more removal done on because I've already paid over $10,000 for removal and don't have the time or money because I'm clawing my way out of debt so I can realize other dreams...), and the feeling of those regrets and anxieties is so ancient for me, so fundamentally part of who I've always been and who I've become, that it really feels hopeless at times. 

Actually, ""hopeless"" feels a bit toothless when it comes to describing the sense of doom and brokenness that overwhelms me on a regular basis. What I feel is something closer to suddenly being the victim in a horror movie in which I was fed a powerful hallucinogen which kicked in at the exact same time as everyone I know and loved turned on me and revealed how much they despise me and told me what a joke they all think I am...well, maybe that's a bit dramatic, but it's somewhere between the two, and it definitely involves a distinct feeling of being so terribly broken and malfunctioning, so embarrassing, so dim witted and useless, and so chaotic and unreliable that I will either end up dead or in jail.

I just feel broken.

Interactions with other people are hopelessly fraught with awkwardness and fumbled sentences, avoidant eye contact at a critical moment, or too much eye contact. Social situations are also overshadowed by this through-line of disappointment at the difference between who I think I should be, or who I really, really want to be (cool a.f Jason Statham type guy with just the right amount of detached and hilarious punk rock comedian who can mingle with intelligentsia with ease) and who I am (hopelessly afraid and awkward guy who is too eager too impress and too stunted to have a normal track record of human relationships (vague complaint, I know, there is no ""normal"", but I really feel stunted when it comes to connecting with people, both friends and loved ones).

If my mind would shut up for a little while I'd be able to bask in what is actually a pretty good life, because most of what tortures me is in my head....

Well, I now feel ashamed that other people will see this (even though I've shot my deepest darkest out in to the internet on various forums countless times) and have run out of things to say, so I will abruptly end here!

985,"I've really done it this time I'm 18 and a senior in high school. Diagnosed depression and ADHD. Both are really bad (one because of the other). I'm taking college classes full time as a high school student and am accepted into the best college in the state, as well as having the Bright Futures scholarship (specific to Florida) and financial support from voc rehab (due to aforementioned ADHD/depression). That's  $50,000 of free money and I was due to graduate with my Associates at the same time I was supposed to graduate with my high school diploma.

It's less than 3 weeks until the end of the school year. I haven't been able to keep up with the work. ADHD too severe. Zeros on pretty much everything. I have an F in one of the courses I need to graduate high school and to get my AA. If I can keep up with the rest of the work for the semester, I can scrape by with a D. I'm an A student. Things have never been this bad. I'm not stupid, my standardized test scores are near perfect. I just can't do the work. With a D, I'll graduate high school, but won't get my AA. I've emailed the professor begging her to open up some late assignments so I can get partial credit. She declined. Trying to get the adaptive services to butter her up, and they'll try, but they admit there's really nothing they can do at this point.

I'll most likely get the D, most likely have to take a summer course to finish my AA, but I'll lose my acceptance into the college of my dreams. I was planning on moving into a house with my friends and my girlfriend since we were all going to the same college. But my parents aren't going to pay for me to live and go to community college up in that college town anymore now that I'm a failure, not that I want to go to the community college anyway but my mom is crazy and emotionally manipulative and I need to get out of my house. That $50,000? Going to be gone. I can't pay for college. If I reapply for Bright Futures or that college, they'll see the D and deny me. My girlfriends mental health is also precarious and she's depending on me to go and move in with her. I can't NOT move in with her, but I won't be able to attend or afford college.

Everything is ruined. Besides the actual logistics of everything, what remains of my pride is shattered. I didn't have much to cling on to, I was that ""gifted"" kid who was given an inflated sense of self worth but no means on surviving in the real world. My ADHD had kept me from being successful in every aspect of my life, but at least I had academic success and was relatively intellectual. Apparently not anymore. There was so little expected of me, ""just make it through one more semester of high school."" Couldn't do it. Nobody understands what it's like to live with ADHD like mine. ""Oh just pay more attention."" Nevermind that it's turned me into a vegetable who can barely take care of my own hygeine.

My options are limited. Slim to no chance I'm going to get a C in that class. So I'll lose the acceptance and the scholarships. I can stay and live with my mentally ill mother and do classes locally, while my future with my girlfriend falls apart, and I eventually kill myself. I can move in with my friends, forget about college, forget about my dreams, become a wage slave, and eventually I'll kill myself. I could  move up and go to college anyway, racking up tens of thousands of dollars worth of debt, and eventually kill myself. Or, I could just save myself the trouble and kill myself now.

It used to be that the only thing holding me back was my love for my dad, but I'm just a disappointment to him now, so I can't let him down much more than I already have.

2829,"Thank you. I have had a hard couple of years and depression has taken over. While I really feel for you all it's comforting to know I'm not the only one.

My wife died just over a year ago. There's still an argument as to weather the hospital killed her or the cancer. A number of health professionals feel it was the hospital. It left me drained and exhausted afterwards. Then I spent 4 months going through a complaints process with the hospital. Boy they don't make those easy. It was a strange process. A number of people in the health sector asked me, almost.pleaded me to complain because they were killing patients. 

Anyways at my wife's funeral my sister was on walking sticks. I didn't get to find out till later it was because she had a massive tumor in her brain. She has now been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. 

My father also had prostate cancer. He was operated on a few weeks before my wife died. 

2months ago my friend died from a burst aorta. I never even knew that was a thing.

I had been recently seeing another woman. But she's going through cervical cancer. And doesn't want me around much.

I'm trying to get myself back on track but it's so hard to push through the pain. I tried taking st John's wort but it gave me wicked nightmares every night. And vitamin b gives me insomnia. 

I was given some free counciling but it was only 8 sessions. I am low on money. So I can't afford more. 

I am trying to make a living working part time while looking after my Asperger's daughter. She's 10 but doesn't attend school. Her last school helped me get an exemption so she could be homeschooled. 

So, that's the basics of me. I have very few friends. I'm considered to be bad luck at work because people who share offices close to me at work die. 4 people in 5 years. Although one survived. She had a brain aneurysm with devistating effects. On the bright side my office is quiet because no one is willing to use the ones around me.

3844,"i will never be happy If you take one look at my post history you can see that my life hasn't been the greatest, my childhood was spent getting bullied and even more on the computer, playing video games and watching anime.
I took a liking to weird and obscure stuff very young, so no wonder people didn't like me, i was always that one fucking weirdo who would probably shoot up the school if given the equipment to, i would never actually do that, but everyone thought i would. 
I never had a releationship, or friends, i never talked to anyone until 2 years ago when i forced myself into a friend group, these days they ignore me so it's not like i would call them friends anymore.
But something made me happy a few months ago, i started chatting with a guy, and he was perfect.
We shared the same taste in everything, music, video games, movies, anime, cartoons, fucking everything, even all the fucked up kinks i had, we both were into some degenerate shit and we both could laugh at it and chat about it with no regrets.
We talked about nerdy stuff for 4 days straight, only maybe sleeping for 4 hours at a time, we were completely obsessed with eachother, i never used Telegram that much, i finally feeled normal.
Suddenly, he left me, after 4 days of non-stop chatting, he just faded away.
I messaged him now and then, hoping i'd catch his attention, after a month of me trying to get his attention he replied ""Stop bothering me.""
I've never felt that emotionally numb, the one person that i thought i'd go along well with just told me to fuck off.
I felt empty, i felt dead.
And it's been a month since that last message and i'm still not over it.
If i'm not good enough for someone who is pretty much me, how can i come along with anyone at all?
These kinds of people are rare, people as fucked up and isolated in the mind like me just don't exist, and while that maybe good for the society....
Sometimes i wish i was forced to play football as aa kid, i'd be happier, healthier, and normal.
I hate everything about myself, i'm a worthless nerd who is too weird for even the werid kids, and i fucking hate it.
I know i'm only 17 (male) but i know for a fucking fact that i will never be happy, and i know one of you fucking faggots will try to say ""you have so much to live for"" well name me one writer artist or anyone at all who started whatever they are good at in their 20's or after turning 18, and from scratch.
They don't exist, i've spent my life on the computer trying to learn everything yet i'm abysmal at everything, i cannot be fixed. I suck at even video games, and that's pathetic.
I feel chaotic and tired.
Sure i've been on one discord server lately and while i think i don't fit there at all there's one guy who i've been chatting with and i like him alot but i don't want to seem obsessive, and i feel it's not mutual, he says it is but fuck i'm not trusting anyone again.
I haven't slept well in a week because i've been angry and frustrated with my existance and futileness as a whole. I'm sick of it.
This won't make sense and it's poorly written, but fuck it, i need to vent.

It’s like I try to talk with them and laugh along with them but...somethings..off? I feel like no one likes me anymore. I mean..why would they? I don’t even like myself. I’m not looking for everyone to like me, I just want to feel accepted and not pushed away for once. I need a friend..someone who knows what I’m going through. Someone who I can trust. I’m lonely, and all I really have is myself to turn to. I don’t like myself, my insecurities and anxiety are suffocating me. I can’t look people in the eye anymore, and conversation with people is really hard. I sit alone..no one to talk to.

It’s always the same. I do so well in the summer then around this time of year all my hard work just goes to shit. 

I got one of the worst grades on my paper that I’ve had since... I don’t even know when. So fucking stupid. It’s my fault for being an idiot and getting complacent. Instead of figuring out how to build my grade up, how to pick myself back up, I’m instead thinking of ways out. 

I could drop the class I guess. 

Or I could just “drop” living. It’s just as easy to kill myself as it is to withdraw from a class. 

I have all the necessary tools. I could do it. I want to do it. I’m not going to. But I really really want to. 

I try so hard to break the pattern. I thought this was gonna be my year. I’m just so sick of this cycle. Of building my confidence up then being reminded how much of a failure I am. God I’m such a fucking failure. 24, can’t keep a steady job, haven’t been able to finish a semester in years, still living at home. 

Useless. I am so. Fucking. Useless. 

I thought I was smart. I thought that I had it in me to do well in school. Fuck, I think I actually do. I just can’t get to it because of my own limitations. Of my self fulfilling prophecy. I try, you guys. I really try. And I thought that was what was always lacking within me, that I’ve never tried hard enough. That I had just become complacent. 

I trashed my room. Had “un berrinche” and acted like a child threw all type of shit around my room. Now I have to deal with that. I keep making messes for myself. I am the only source of all my problems. 

Well I tried. And nope, it wasn’t lack of trying that was keeping me back. It was just the fact I am a loser. A failure. An embarrassment. A burden. Worthless. 

I know these are irrational thoughts. I *know* that. But I still feel them. Trying to keep up with those good ol’ CBT tools that I learned in the many years of therapy I’ve received. God so much money wasted on me. Trying to fix something that will always be broken. The more I learn about my disorder, the more I try to understand it and control it, the smarter it gets. My disorder is always one step ahead of me. It learns from my success and then figures out how to tear me down. 

I’m so tired. Of fighting. Of trying. Still contemplating on the whole dying before thirty thing. It’s like when people say to each other “if we’re not married by 30, we should get married!” Except for killing my self. I’ll try not to, but I’ll make sure I have a good plan by 30 to effectively kill myself just in case. It’s comforting. Six years to get my life in order or to come up with a foolproof suicide. 

Alright suicide. It’s a pact. If I’m still a complete failure by 30, we’re gonna finally do it. 

I’m not going to check myself into a psychiatric facility. I’m not going to call my pdoc. I’m not gonna tell anyone about these thoughts except for you guys. I’m not gonna be more of a burden. Telling anyone any of these thoughts will just cause more drama than they’re worth. 

I’m gonna take a bunch of my clonazepam (not OD amount) and sleep for the rest of the day. Today is done. Fuck today. Maybe I’ll feel better tomorrow. Kinda hoping I won’t so I can just get on with killing myself faster.

1271,"Struggling.. Hey guys,

I'm 17 years old at the moment and I would like to share my story, I am sitting in my room, alone, depressed, asking myself why can't I be happy. I guess I just need a place to vent, talk with someone who understands instead of telling me happiness is a choice and stuff. I am also left here with some questions, I will be visiting a psychologist at college next week. 

Since I was around age 15 I have been smoking weed on the regular, it has always been legal over here and it helped me tremendously at the time with some problems I was experiencing. ADD, undiagnosed but I'm almost sure, I self-diagnosed with Adderall-test as well as all my ADD friends telling me they suspect it and going through some of their symptoms with me. 

So at the time, I started when I was 13 years old, but when I was 15 years old I smoked weed around 4-5 days of the week, it really helped me. Before I discovered weed I had a really bad view on life, I have always felt that life is pretty pointless. I need to go to school. Work 40 hours, until I'm almost dead and I can retire. Only so I can spend the bit of money I have left on the weekends. I never felt at home here, but weed gave me insights, it introduced me to spirituality and I was the happiest person in the world, or so my friends told me. They always asked why I was so overly happy for totally nothing etc. 

I am really thankful for discovering MJ at the time but about six weeks ago it all changed. I decided to take a T-break for a month, to see if I wasn't dependent if I would be happy without weed, which I always said I was etc. In this month I slowly noticed me becoming more and more depressed, to the point where I was thinking of ways to take the bus every 5 minutes.

""Oooo nice high building, let's skydive into the fucking ground"", ""If I could just not wake up tomorrow, that would be nice""

It scared me, I was used to being happy, with a low here and there but just, you know, general sadness. After completing the month I decided to start smoking again, but I was debating whether I am fucked in the head or it was just psychological withdrawal. Now that I am back to smoking again for about two weeks... I am afraid that... it doesn't make a difference, it is all still the same. When I am high I'm totally fine, when not though I will be severely depressed. I used to be happy even when sober when I smoked 3-4 times a week before that month. I just feel so lost, is this weed related, am I just depressed. 

Also something to note is that I always had, throughout my youth, and I still do, these periods where I felt like God walking down the street, unstoppable, for example some days ago I wrote a lot, and did calculations on how I will retire at age 25 - 30 and I went on a fucking rant about how great I was and what not, when I look at my future now I just see a fucking failure. It's all uncertainity if I will even make money. After this year I will be dropping out, I'm studying psychology at the moment, and will be focussing on starting my own company. I want to invest time in the company but I just can not most of the time. 

I used to be, from a spiritual viewpoint, grateful to live, grateful to experience, thinking of myself as the universe experience itself, learning. Now my head is filled with emotional poison.

I would like to hear what the fuck I should do from here on? I am thinking of visiting my school dean or go directly to my school psychologists. But I am scared as shit, I don't want them to put me on meds because the reason I stopped with smoking weed that month was that I don't like to depend on something that costs money in order to be happy. FUCK THAT. 

If you made it till here, thanks a lot for reading. I really needed to share. What should I do from here on????

570,"Stronger and more talented people have committed suicide. I have been battling suicidal wishes for about a little more than 10 years. Depression and anxiety, for as long as I know myself as a person (29 and soon 30).

During this time, I have seen strong and talented people commit suicide. From famous artists to my own father. If these people eventually found as conclusion that they should end their life, I wonder what are the chances of me surviving this. I think it's likely that I will get to that point too. Have gotten pretty close many times, and the way I'm planning to do it, there is zero chance of surviving anyway.

I had heard that suicidal thoughts were stronger while close to personal tragedies and on people starting antidepressants and on young people. I've gone through those phases, and it's just gotten worse. My fears about failing in life have actually become true. My family is shorter and shorter, my friends are gone, I live in  complete solitude in an empty apartment, filled with filth that I don't have the will power to clean, I eat barely nothing, sleep terribly, hate my job (where I am abused everyday), and think about suicide every five minutes of my waking hours. It is a nightmare scenario that I predicted years ago.

I know that there are people like me out there. It would be nice to meet them, I guess. It would also suck. Life is obviously full of happy and sad moments, but something went wrong for us. I think in previous times we would be dead very soon, and now we are blessed to live this torture over and over while receiving here and there some glances of how life was supposed to be like. But those glances are teases, they don't last long, and it's always a question of: is life worth living for those tiny moments?",suicide_watch,ID32872_suicide_watch,"

So i decided to change my life like i think 3 months ago after almost jumping off a building (You can see it in one of my posts in r/SuicideWatch in my acc),Since i couldn't do it...Right now im doing great in life alone,In such a young age of 14,Im doing well alone,I workout 5 times a day and wake up at 6:00AM just to practice basketball everyday even though im a HS Dropout ( Going to school soon dont worry lol ) And im disciplined in a good level too.

So when i decided to get strong and disciplined,I suddenly hated crying,It felt like im so weak and when i cry even for a little,The demon in my mind comes back,So no matter i cant cry,For anyone's information,I never tried treating this depression,Anxiety,Psychosis and other more disorders i have for atleast once,I know it's bad but no one still trusts me so i cant worry about it yet...But i want to atleast be able to cry because it's the only way i let out my emotions alone,But if i do,My usual self comes back,I never cried for 3 months until 2 days ago because i felt sad lol,But then it continued,I started getting sad and crying continuously everyday again which im scared might turn into something big and pull me back down,It's basically a 0% or a 100% , Either i dont cry or i cry and turn back to myself,I wanna be strong enough to help everyone,To protect everyone,It's hard but i want to do it for the sake of my loved ones,But how can i do it if they dont understand my emotions?..I cant tell it to anyone because not a single person in our family has enough mental knowledge to help me,It'll just end up to me being sad even more if i do tell it...When im sad,I cry too but only like a few little tears i didn't mean to drop,I just try to stop it but i want to let it all out,I just dont want myself to come back...

But not long ago I've been in the biggest shit hole ever, I've lost everything my family have left me, I quit school and was just going with the flow for days for now.
Getting high, making junkie music trying to find a reason to be alive, meeting people that would leave after few days, doing nothing just living this circle of nothingness and continuous depression.
Many people say that depression isn't a thing, that it just comes out of boredom that teenagers and whatnot get themselves into. But if that's true then depression would cause the same so we can acknowledge the fact that this circle exists and it's only natural to get yourself into it.
That's what I've been telling myself for years though.

It just didn't make any sense to me it was just as if this world was nothing but a black and white screenplay of fear and sorrow.
I just gave into it I lived as if that was the premiss for my life, as if there wasn't anything else that could change that.

But few days ago I've met this wonderful person and I don't think I know I've found my soulmate someone who makes me feel the way I can't really describe or show it's just there.
This someone understands me the way no one else ever has understood me made me want to get my shit together and made me want to move on from that and with every day I'm just giving more and more into this emotion.
I've began practicing my passions, I've started looking for a job I've finally accepted the fact that all that happened has happened.
And after all these years of fear and sorrow I just want to get it out there, I finally feel human once again and it's amazing it's the most astonishing feeling in the world.

47,"A long story about how I end up here My current situation is that I'm depressed, socially anxious and extremely lonely. 

I'm posting this in the hope dat Its something to talk about with someone. Maybe someone can pull me back to the ground. 

I've written thus pretty quickly so sorry for the typos in advance. 

Writing this story is actual the first one so I don't know what other perspectives there will be. But the first one will be the most realistic one. The one that's in my head and the one I'm currently living. No lies, no bullshit, no beautifying things. It's not a nice story, it's not a beautiful story. I hope it's written in a way you can follow, and I hope you enjoy it, I hope you can understand. And maybe this will never be seen by anyone other's eyes. 

The reason I'm writing this I because I want to get it out of me. For the first time I feel that I can actually change my thoughts. Maybe just maybe I can trust again. Maybe my thoughts of worthlessness and being the worst person can fade away. Maybe I need help. Maybe my dark and scaring thoughts can go away. Maybe someone will read this and can understand or maybe relate to this. Just maybe ... 
 

So let me take you back. Think of this boy 16 years old just moved, for the 3 time in 5 years. His mom was kind of his Idol. She was always there and she was able to keep me safe and protect me a little bit from my strict dad. 
Friends a had a few. I switched schools a few times so I didn't make a lot. Some were colleagues some work classmates. O and I mustn't forget, I had a girlfriend. She's my first girlfriend and she was a
2 year older then me. I don't think I really liked her that much, but for the first time someone liked me instead of falling for a girl that's way out of my league. So I stuck with her for a while. 

So almost immediately after we moved my parents started fighting. They did this before but not as much as they did now. The fights were different. They didn't had a subject, they were just fighting for the heck of it. My sisters, of which I have 2, didn't live with us anymore. They moved out and the youngest one only went back once every few weekends. They didn't notice it as much, but even they could tell something was wrong. 

After a few months my mom decided it was time to go to her parents, she would talk with them about my parents relation. On that moment I got back from work and my sister was back home as well. When we sat down, my dad's phone when off. He got a text from my mom, but it wasn't addressed to my dad. It said something as follows:

Hi dear, just talked to my parents, Hmm. Doesn't look that bright anymore. Probably won't take long any more, hmm. Miss you, love. 

This is all I remember off it and it's translated so it won't be 100% but you'll get the gist of it. And you'll also probably guess this wasn't supposed to go to my dad. It's was meant for someone else. My dad, sister and I all read the message, and could believe our eyes. What does this mean, what will happen now? 

At this point is was scared, no frightened. Frightened of the thought my parents would divorce. Frightened of the thought that I'm probably going to have to choose a side. Choose between the person you trusted with whole your life, but now seems can't be trusted and the person that was always strict. 
When my mom got back from her parents, she asked for my dad to come outside with her cause something went wrong and she had to explain her self. She told a very nice story. It's just how she and her colleagues texted with each other. For a second I wanted to believe that. I wanted it to be true,. But I knew it's probably not. This will be marked as the start of the divorce it thought to myself. 
My sister and I talked to her, she promised the didn't lie, that's she  old be trusted and she would never do such a thing. Yet again, I wanted to believe it so for then, I just accepted it, went upstairs and tried to sleep. 
Like I said this night would be marked as the start of the divorce, but it's also first thing I can recall what is damaging me I guess. After this night I can't remember a lot. It feels like my recordings have stopt for a few days / weeks. 
The next event I know, but I'm not totally sure where it fits in the time line, is coming downstairs on Sunday too see my sitting at the diner table, crying. Crying his heart out. Being broken by the months and months of arguing with my mom about nothing. He was devastated and didn't know what to do anymore. At that moment I didn't know what to do. I wanted to comfort him, but I didnt feel present at that moment. My sister was already up and she was talking to him. Trying to calm him down. 
Like I said I didn't k ow what to do. I wanted to hug him, but he always had seem to be arms length away from me. The thing I regret the most now about this, is that I was too scared of my own emotions to stay or to comfort my dad. I took my stuff and went to work. At work time stood still. It was comforting cause I  could clear my mind but also upsetting cause I wanted to go to my family. I wanted to know what was going on. I talked to my girlfriend who was working at the same place at the time. She didn't really help. She didn't have that much empathy and couldn't really listen to my story. When my shift ended I went home and that's the last I remember about it. 
At times I think the evening marked as the start was adjacent to the Sunday morning, but that just doesn't seems right. 

The last event before the divorce that I know is the most haze one. I only k ow a few things. I was up in my room, I wasn't alone. But I don't know if a friend was there or my girlfriend. My dad was at home. So it's probably a Saturday or Sunday. 
Suddenly my mom opens the door and tells me she packed a few things and is going away. I remember her asking me something. I don't know what. I belive it was either: do have anything to say go my? Or : would you care to join me? 
Either way I stayed in my room and that's the last I know of it. 
It turned out my dad had heard her over the phone, talking to a friend of hers, saying ""I know it's wrong, but when ever I hear his voice, it's like falling in love again"". This is when my dad said she should pack a back and go. 

Soon after this broke up with my girlfriend, the fact that I didn't really like her that much and I didn't fell that well and she could help me pushed me over the ledge to do it. 

So when my mom got out of the house she stayed a few weeks in her colleagues home. He didn't life there cause he just moved in with his girlfriend I believe, but I'm not sure. Our dad forced us a couple of times to get over there. Talk to to her, he always said ""don't forget, she's still your mother"". 
I found it extremely difficult, just talking to her, she broke my trust, She made my dad cry.  I didn't k know what for say but the fact that I was disappointed or even discussed by her mad when feel bad. And I wanted her to feel bad. I wanted her to feel the worst of us all. She'd deserved that. I deserved that, but she didn't. Or maybe she did but she never showed after that one night. 

Within a year she told us she had met someone else. When we asked of he was this person she meant to text during the first event. She promised us this is someone else. An old friend. It was my dad's best friend, at least I believe he was. They even had a certificate about it, and they both had it hanging in the hall way. 

After she promised, after we started to believe we found out he was that person all along. It also turned out that my mom talked and went to him even before the whole arguing started. Phone records showed everything she did and for how long it went on. Even showing this she held on to her lie. This is the hardest part of trusting someone, trust in someone is as strong as they are believable. my mom, not so much. 
After a while I found a girl, who was amazing. I thought she was beautiful. From the moment I first layed eyes on her I though, damn this is something else. 
And she was. It took me some time to persuade her. She first wanted to stay friends and such. The  she fooled around with someone else. That was the first time she hurt me actually. She lied about that. Maybe that was some kind of sign, maybe not. After that I tried again  and succeeded. She was officially my girlfriend and I've never felt better at that point. 
We did a lot together but not everything. So we had space to our self. She was needy though, but not too much. After being together for almost a year I decided to move. I wanted to stay in dorms close to my school, and so I died. At first the didn't like that. She wanted to keep me close. But I couldn't stand the traveling for 3-4 hours a day. Eventually the was OK with that. 
After half a year she went studying as well. She learned new people and I was very happy about it. She would get more grown up and that's what is was hoping for her. But, as she said afterwards, she got bored with me. But she didn't want to break up. I thought everything was still OK. When the next event happend. 
She wanted me to come with her to church for Christmas. You must understand, I've never been to a church before. At least not as a not tourism thing. So after a few I thought we'll off course, for her I will. 
So I went with her and her family. And I think it was one of the worst things I've been too. Like the priester would got on and on about how people should live more closely to the Bible. People didn't respect it as much. And I was sitting there, not even red a bible, not even a few words. 
Afterwards there was no thank you from her. She didn't look amused. So later that day after dinner I asked what was going on. We took a walk and then she said she wanted to break up. She didn't had explanation. She just wanted to be single. 
I was devastated, didn't see it coming. I was high up there and suddenly everything was pulled away underneath me. Most of you will probably know how it's feels to be dumped without knowing it was coming. 
I asked her if there was someone else. She promised there wasn't, but off course there was. There was this guy is her class I hadn't heard a lot about him, but I knew who he was. I found out because she was still logged in on my pc and saw all her recent chats. 
Again the trust in someone completely shattered. But I was still head over heels. So I kept trying. 4 months later we started dating again, but there was no trust. I doubted everything she would say I didnt believe a word she would say. 
Its hard to life like this. And I've seen some dark sides of my self that I hope never have to see again. This lasted almost a year then she wanted to go to her father in South Africa. And that's when I said we should break up. This isn't going to work. At this time it was mutual, but trust didn't restore. 

A year later I got a girlfriend again  it was fun at all, but I believe I wasn't in love with her. 

After a while my oldest sister would drop her contact what she had with our mom. She didn't want to hear anything about it anymore. To be honest, I don't know what the last straw was. I do remember her arguing in the car, and me waiting on the outside till she was done. 

My connection to my mother is nihil. Almost absent, she never apologized to me personally and never asks why I never call or something. It's like she's not bothered by the fact that she feel like an aunt or even a distant relative. When the divorce happened there was this big drama about money possession and such. 
My dad was crazy enough to pay for her motorcycle license. I don't know ow anymore why this happens, but it did. My mother didn't want to help my dad with keeping the household running. He was paying the mortgage on its own and even provided everything for me. He could barely come around. The hard part for me was that she didn't want the help my dad, knowing he was providing for me. That's how much I'm worth to my mother I guess. The though nothing more. This one stings, and is one that keeps on getting back. 

When I broke up with my second girlfriend one of my friends hurt me like damn hard. I was close to him, he was a very good friend of my. I losend a little bit. Did talk a bit about my parents, just barley. When his birthday came around he didn't invite me to come over or anything. Apparently was the brother of my ex more important he got to go, I had to hear from someone else. I'd expected that he'd atleast let me know, but nothing. After I asked he said that I would maybe had a hard time with it. Him not even asking was kinda a slap in my face and I left it at that. I'm not saying this is his fault but this adds up to the pile of things I can't seem to process. Now you might think this isnt that big of a deal, but only having 4 real friends, missing one is hard. 

And soon enough after graduating the other friends faded as well. The current count is 1 and I don't anyway how I can get that number up anymore. 

Work is the only positive in my life though. I'm good at it. Colleagues look up to me and it comes easy to me. There is also this one colleague. I was very close with her. Told here some dark thoughts. She seemed to listen, so at one point I tried. I tried to reach out but it didn't work. I told her I'm in a hole and can't get out. I told her the I don't see anything positive about even being here. She listened and listened. Afterwards she said  what about this other colleague? Can't you talk with him also? And didn't hear anything from her for a few weeks. Not even the question, jeez how are you doing? Are you as OK as that smile your putting on? This really hurts because I was kinda hoping we could have been friends. But all that I'm for her is a colleague, and never will be more. 
This time I reached out, it took so much energy. Months after it happened I 'woke up' again. Can't recall any that happened in that period. I know that I was done and decided I needed a change. 
I decided I'd go to China for a few weeks, went there, and life felt great. I was able to make friends. To myself I looked social again. For a few week my dark side could near me. 
I was sleeping in hostels and contact with people was so easy and fun to do. But this only lasted as long as my vacation lasted. Getting back was hard, after just a week I felt down again. Seeing her at work reminded me of everything I wanted but wasn't able to. The next month's are not recorded again. I was asleep. 

When I traveled to China I stopped in dubai. Here I met a girl. We met trough Tinder(I know right). But she is amazing. She always is there for me and really helped me out quite some times. The only bad thing, she isn't close. I can't just go to her, which in many many cases I wish I could. 

This not recording or sleeping is something is hard to explain. I don't know when I'm a sleep. I do know when I'm awake. When I'm awake if always feel like I want it to change. These are also the times I talk alot with the girl from dubai. I like to think she really understands me. She close enough I can open up, but lives far away, so I'm less scared she would breake my trust.

By now you might think, you had 4 friends 2 faded, one ended, where is this last friend in all of this. Why is he one of persons you talk to when you're awake, how comes he doesn't know. Well it's simple, for one he's to close. I don't need to show my trust if I don't let him see anything is wrong. Don't get me wrong, I'm greatfull he is my friend, but I don't want to put trust in something I'm not sure off. He has this believe that state of mind is fully controlled by your self, if you don't want to feel it you'll not feel it and there won't be it. Take sadness for example, if you don't want to feel sad you'll not be sad if you don't let it. Quite strong character you can say, but it also makes that he has less feel for empathy. He won't ask because he doesn't wants to seround himself with bad feelings. And I belive he would see a cry out for help for what it really is. Can't blame him, I would steer away as well if I knew what was coming I guess. 

So by now you'll probably think that this isn't this hard and they are just things I need to process or just let it be because I can't influence anything of it. Maybe you're right, but try to see through my perspective. I'm having a serious trust issue and I'm withholding my self of being social with any one new, so it's kinda hard to process it on my own. 

So I talked about the whole social part. This is one of the things om not anymore. I feel like since I graduated I can't converse with anyone new. I find it hard to come up with questions to ask. It's hard because it always feels I'm not interesting enough for the other person. Plus it always feels my common knowledge is going as far as the most of them. Maybe this varies per location, or group of persons. I don't feel like this with my best friend, I do feel like it when someone new gets introduced to me or with anyone at work. The only one who doesn't bring up that feeling is the colleague I've spoken off before. 

The only thing that is left behind are my thoughts. My thoughts and I have been locked up with each other for quite some time now. And they do collide every now and then. Sometimes my thoughts wants everything to stop. And not just the thinking but just everything. Feeling nothing, being nothing. And the only nothing I know, is something I don't want. I still believe that there is something to stay for. My thoughts just think otherwise. ",depression,ID40484_depression,"

1385,"My Stepbrother Molested Me So when I was 6 my mum was dating this guy (who would later become my stepdad) and he had a son around 7 years older than me (let’s call him Max). After a few months our families moved in together and one night Max asked me to come sleep in his room. So I was laying there in the dark and Max whispers to me and asked if I wanted to touch him and I didn’t understand what was happening but he pulled his pants down and grabbed my hand and put it on his crotch and then started touching mine. 
This happened a few times over the next couple months and that whole time I never understood what he was doing, I knew it was wrong because whenever I tried to ask him about it he would get really angry and tell me to shut up. 

And what really happened didn’t really click in my brain until I was about 14/15 and it really messed me up because that was also around the time I started to accept that I was gay and I kept thinking (and sometimes I still do to this day) that I’m gay because I was molested by him at such a young age and that I’m just fucked up in the head forever because of it. I tell myself it’s not true and that’s not how sexuality works but what do I really know? I’ve been out of the closet for 4 years but a little part of me still hates the fact that I’m gay because that thought is always in the back of my mind. 

And I don’t even know if I’m allowed to feel this way because he wasn’t even that much older when it happened and it didn’t even affect me until a few years ago. Like does it even count? I know I feel shitty about it but it’s nowhere near as bad as most people have it. Like he wasn’t an adult so idk if I’m allowed to even feel this way. I want to bring it up with someone so I can talk to them about it and get it off my chest for real but idk if they’ll just laugh at me because it really could’ve been so much worse. 

I lived with the guy for about 4 years until my mum and stepdad got divorced and I never thought about what had happened. But now I can’t even hear his name without feeling sick and angry and frustrated. How did it not affect me for so long only to pop up now and make me feel so shitty? 

And how would I even bring this up with someone? Like, I’m definitely not comfortable bringing it up with anyone in my family... Is it too much to bring it up with my best friend? Would that make things weird? I haven’t told anyone about this before and I really need to vent to someone irl but I’m just so scared to start talking about it.

I feel horrible because we've been through so much together. She stayed with me even as I went through having voices in my head and staying at the hospital for treatment. But i just can't bring myself to feel the same way about her. It's killing me too, but if I do this right, she'll hate me and I'll be able to go without her missing me.

4119,"My thought process Delusion Example -

Internal Dialogue: ""If I suicide in the first semester of 3rd year rather than my second semester this will better escape the possibility of anyone thinking Uni or my Uni grades had something to do with my suicide""

Me: ""I should write down this thought to show how delusional it is.""

Result: I am such an honest person or I commit suicide better than these other people or I am such an academic that I can objectively analyze my reasons for suicide or I am so great at x , blah blah blah blah.

Complete ignorance that if I was such an honest, academic, rational x then I wouldn't be in my current situation. If I really was so honest then I'd have told someone about this.

Actual delusion is not just in the internal dialogue but it manipulates my thought process so pervasively and inescapably that all results from internal dialogue are just fuelling further delusions, how do you fight something that can just shapeshift like this and always produce some form of delusion no matter the thought.

Once the delusion is found and caught it immediately starts creating/fuelling a new delusion.

The delusions are so common that all thoughts &amp; behaviours are either self-censored or I let the delusion play itself out to the full end, either way doesn't this mean I'm not really me anymore? This then provides justification for suicide, this is probably also a delusion.

Used to think I could tell what was delusional and what wasn't but isn't the point of being delusional that you don't realize it? This leads to constant seeking of approval from others, constant triple-checking of what I've revealed to who because I drift thoughts by others to see if they're delusional or not and if I float two contradictory ideas to someone too close together then the delusion might get exposed.

This wouldn't bother me but it's assumed I am my delusions or that I take responsibility for them, either way, in the eyes of others the delusions are my fault, something inherently wrong with me rather than something that is affecting me. Maybe this is also a delusion.

Further delusion: ""Now let's say I put this whole thing in my suicide note, well wouldn't that just be a fantastic psycho-analysis of myself.""

I don't know everything is just foggy, I don't even know if what I just wrote is actually accurate or still just delusional and completely detached, maybe I have bipolar and I'm just having some sort of manic thought derailing, I don't know if I really mean what I say.",depression,ID14429_depression,"

1247,"I want it to stop I hate my life. I haven't been happy in years. I'm 16 years old, have been struggling with depression for my whole life, and have been contemplating suicide since I was 13. 

My whole life is fucked. I'm a social failure, I have no motivation or drive at all, and I likely have PTSD from when my sister tried to kill herself in front of me. 

I've stopped trying in school, even though I used to be a great student. I'm not trying to brag, but I'm smart and used to be top of my class in everything. I've just stopped caring. Life doesn't feel real. I look at my grades and the way I'm fucking up my future and I just... don't give a shit, and I know I should but I can't make myself. I've tried so hard but I can't. It's like I'm watching my future go off the rails and it doesn't bother me. I have no idea what I want to do with my life, but I guess it doesn't matter because I don't want to live long enough to see how it turns out. There's no way to could be good. 

I've tried talking to my parents but they don't get it. They can't see any way that I could be different from them. I've told them time and time again that I hate school, that I'm not happy, but they never listen and never do anything to help. They always ask me what I want, but never do anything.

2113,"I have Anxiety, Depression, and Dermatillomania. And also really crappy parents. My Fiancé told me I should post this here. I don’t know why I pick. Sometimes I think it’s out of boredom, sometimes I think it’s because the pimple or whatever is hurting me and I need to relieve the pressure. I don’t even know what triggers it. Sometimes I just get this uncontrollable urge to pull all the dirt and gross shit out of my face and I can’t help it. My parents never really got that. They thought it was something that by punishing me or yelling at me about it or guilting me they could make it stop- but it didn’t. it only made me better at hiding it. I stopped picking in the morning, and one of the ways I stopped was by quitting wearing makeup- generally- I avoid mirrors in the morning all together. At this point it’s not even a conscious decision anymore. I don’t look in the mirror until I am safely in my car and I use the tiny mirror on the sun visor to put on my makeup. That way- I end up seeing less of my face. I started only picking late at night- after I knew they would no longer bother me and I would be alone and at peace. But this also made it worse- because I didn’t have a time limit. I can’t gauge time when I pick. Sometimes I just go on for hours and don’t even realize what time it is. I remember one time- I started picking at ten and didn’t stop until two in the morning. That was the night that I picked so deep into my nose that I pulled out a vein. I was frightened- there was so much blood- but I couldn’t do anything about it because if I had told my parents I would have been ridiculed. At least that’s what I thought at the time, now, looking back at it- maybe it would have been a wakeup call. Maybe they would have realized something was wrong. Maybe I would have gotten a therapist. But I also know- these maybes are there because I’m trying to justify still loving my parents by blaming myself for a lot of the things that I know where not my fault. If they really cared enough, if they really were concerned about my wellbeing… they would have taken me to the doctor long before this moment happened. Sometimes I wonder if my picking was also a form of self-harm. I dabbled in that. For a while I sliced open my legs with razor blades and hit myself on the bony parts of my body with the handle of my hairbrush until I bruised. I would beat my collar bones, by hip bones, my ankles, and my hands. I think I was doing it because it had the same effect as picking. I lost track of time, I didn’t have to think about anything but causing a purple spot on my hip. Eventually, I didn’t even feel the pain anymore. 
I don’t know why I stopped hurting myself. Maybe it wasn’t enough anymore. Maybe it was hopelessness. Maybe I decided it wasn’t worth the questions from anyone except my parents anymore. All I know is I stopped. Not the picking-I still do that today, but the bruising and cutting and burning myself. I think at that point I had decided that the best thing I had in my life was sleep. If I was asleep I wouldn’t have to deal with the yelling, the ridicule, the loneliness of school. I never really had a lot of close friends. I always thought it was because I was weird- but I now know that is was mostly because I wasn’t allowed to get to know anyone very well. my family was so fucked up that they didn’t want to have me understand that this was abuse- that what they were doing was neglect. I never observed any family except my own. And no one except the most extreme cases ever share their stories on the internet. For this reason, suicide was never an option. I am a very empathetic and sympathetic person. All the stories I had ever read about abuse, neglect… they were always worse that what I thought mine was. And those people succeeded- those people did not take their own lives. I could never take away my life when so many people had it so much worse than me- or so I thought. But because I was not allowed to learn how normal families coexist I didn’t know how truly awful mine was. I had every right to be suicidal- but I also knew, in the back of my mind- that if I were to commit suicide my life wouldn’t mean anything. My parents didn’t really believe in mental illness- and I was worried that if I committed suicide and left them a note they would burn the note and try to make it look like something else was going on. I was worried they wouldn’t take any of the blame. I was worried my brother would grow up being the brunt of all their abuse. I was worried they wouldn’t give a shit.",off_my_chest,ID26593_off_my_chest,"

Well, it’s starting to take over my life with the shaking and the panic attacks and the “feeling like something horrible is about to happen” at *all* times.

After over a year of hospital stays, manic episodes and what not, I finally felt well enough to apply for a job at a salon I have been going to and I was hired the same day! I was so proud and excited! I told my friends and family and my sister even took me out for drinks to celebrate.

Then came Monday and it was just a training day. My anxiety got the best of me and didn’t sleep at all Sunday night but I think I did well on Monday except for a few times I think I talked way more than I should have and possibly said some stupid shit. So then I was scheduled to work again today. I haven’t slept this entire time, I’m manic and have had 3 panic attacks. I’m obviously not ready yet and I feel like such an asshole for even trying.

2512,"Hello I hope you all had a merry Christmas!

I'm new here, but I should probably have checked in many years ago. Talking to other people helps some times, and you can't say everything to family and loved ones - atleast not in my case.

I'm 24 years old and I have been battling my demons since I was 8 years old. I used to do alright until I was in my midteens, but it all got much worse from there on out.

I have been thinking about suicide every day for the last 6 years. The reason why I haven't done it is because I don't want to leave my little siblings with the void of a lost brother. But then again, I can't keep living for someone else for the rest of my life.

All I do is work. I have 3 jobs. One full time and two smaller jobs. The reason why is because I hate being left alone in my own mind, so I try to keep myself occupied as much as possible. It's really though nowadays because I have lost a lot of weight. I don't really have the energy to do anything. As soon as I'm done working I go home to sleep.

I want to go out and catch up with friends and family, but my personality has changed too much now. My mind is all mushy and strange – like I'm just a shell of who I used to be. Keeping up in normal conversations is hard, and I'm too nervous to say anything. I don't even know what to say to people anymore.

I have tried to get help a lot of times, like talking to a psychologist, open psychiatric department. Even closed psychiatric department. This only messed me up even more to be honest, because it got in the way of my jobs. All my jobs are based on monthly contracts (it's hard to get a permanent job with my education. You normally have to work for 4 years until they have to hire you by law). I can't spend a lot of time getting help without the risk of losing my jobs.

Does any of you have any similar experiences, or maybe some ideas for what I could do?",depression,ID25745_depression,"

1254,"Feel like the only cure is suicide, but I dont want to suicide - weird feeling, pls help, mood swings Hi, I dont really know where to put this post, but I feel like it is somewhat DP related. So it seems like either I push through or believe my mind which flipped over 4 months ago. I seriously feel like since this has started that Ive been destined to suicide. So my mind is so unbelievably destructive and I am severely depressed, not that I dont want to do anything, rather cant imagine doing anything with these thoughts, more like intrusive feelings based on false beliefs. Basically I recovered from DPDR this year, everything is as it used to be except for my mind. It is so worn out because the 6 months of DP were too much I guess. It is so worn out that I could convince myself that I died when DP hit me in February. There is nothing worse than no symptoms but still irrational thinking. It recently hit me with massive bouts of hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. It feels like I shouldnt be here anymore. 4 months ago I thought suicide was an absurd thing (for me) and even during DP suicide didnt even cross my mind one single time. But now it feels like my worst imaginations came true and it is just pure mental pain. Everything about future is triggering the hell out of me, I cant picture myself in the future anymore without thinking (maybe I might have killed myself by then?!), it is so difficult to even hold the place at university, but Ive already decided that I'd drop out.

It all changed in July where I had ups and downs but in the beginning of August these intrusive bouts of suicidal thoughts (like I hit a threshold and the only way out would be suicide, because it felt so terribly painful, like I was destined to suicide) hit me out of the blue and I suddenly became paranoid of time and future... It is not that I dont want to live anymore but my mind doesnt. It is strange...:( So basically it felt like my mind decided: your life is over now. This feeling freaked me out and days have been a struggle since then because it seriously felt like there is no way out but suicide. Since August everything triggers the feeling that I should be dead, even my hobby: drumming, music. Biggest trigger: sounds hilarious, but it is the date. It seems like I hit some kind of threshold in August, since then, time triggers these suicidal feelings, like I am supposed to not be here anymore. Damn this is undescribable, even more than DPDR itself. Most strange thing: 

IT FEELS LIKE I SHOULD HAVE DIED, SOME DARK FEELING WHICH EATS ME AND THAT I'D BE DESTINED TO SUICIDE! I have a really bad urge to feed in to these feelings even though I know Id made it worse... I really have no clue how to recover from this hell. It feels like the only reason I feel like that is because I have a strong belief that something has to die or that something is very wrong with my mind.

Most people look at me different because of the color of my skin. One of the people I'm closest to, said that she would never date guys from my place.

1643,"I've really been trying to overcome my mental disorders but this world just seems to want me to wallow in the depths of hell. I've spent the last 5 months in intensive outpatient care for my opiate addiction stemming from rampant depression.

I've been faithfully attending meetings with mental health professionals for almost a decade now.

I've been the driving force behind my family increasing our mental health as a whole.

But yet again I let my guard down and try to find some outside outlet to develop a social life. A friend whom I've been talking to for about four months called me on Wednesday in a super frantic state due to his grandmother being found uncouncious and being rushed to the hospital. I immediately dropped all obligations of my own and stayed with him at the hospital for over 8 hours. 
I provided him with food, money, cigarettes, and whatever else he needed even though I'm destitute; I figured in his situation he needed it more. When his grandmother was about to be admitted to an upstairs room and visitors were being told to leave as you cannot stay upstairs overnight we agreed he would stay at my place due to his place being about 6 miles away from the hospital while my place is only 5 blocks away. Well as we were walking to my apartment about one block away he tells me he has changed his mind and wants to go to his girlfriend's house which is 8 miles away from the hospital.

This was the first event that I went beyond being spotty friends and chose to include him in my inner circle, and he recripicated the same feelings to me. In a fury I confronted him over this, as every time we've made plans to spend an extended period of time together he has made excuses, which as we were not too close at the time I accepted.

However this struck a cord with me. After being hurt over and over again by past friends treating me as dirt I let him in my circle after spending close to half of a day consoling him and doing everything I could to comfort him. I exploded with anger, yelling and screaming at him. Shortly after this police afraid as I was too emotional to remember it was 2 30 am. As they arrived he said I wouldn't let him leave and they did not question him further and let him leave, and then proceeded to question me in my hysteria as to why I was screaming and why I was so upset. In my anger I told, and possibly screamed at them that I had been betrayed and wanted to walk the one block left to get home. This resulted in me being arrested for disorderly conduct.

The arrest was not legal for many reasons but that's not what I want to vent about here. Yet again I open myself up to try and gain friends to help with my devastating depression and yet again I've been burned. Thank goodness my mother is still around who is the only thing I care for in this world or I would've left this world within the last few nights.

Depression has driven me into a horrible state of isolation and 3very attempt to develop a healthy lifestyle leads to more problems. None of the things I've been doing to combat this disease have made me see why life is worth living. And I'm sorry if this breaks the rules, but I can't wait until my mom reaches the end of her life so I can reach the end of mine.",depression,ID1081_depression,"

3504,"Stopping Impending Break Down Two weeks ago I could feel the manic stage coming on. I gave everyone around me a heads up. I didn't sleep at all Sunday night and went full blown manic Monday. Not all the symptoms but enough to cause issues so I took 3 days off from work and isolated till the worst of it passed. Presently I am still manic, but it's tolerable and I'm able to handle the symptoms.

I was supposed to have my kids all week for the holiday. My wife won't allow it and since it's a civil matter police can't enforce it so there's nothing I can do. That hurts. I was really looking forward to seeing my kids for 9 days and getting to spend quality time with them. I had all this stuff planned. Now I'm just sitting alone trying not to cry loud enough for anyone to hear.

I got fired for an undisclosed reason. I made good money, money I needed for child support, health insurance, paying of my ex's debt in my name, getting my own place. I was three paychecks away from paying off the last credit card and getting my own place. I hate where I live now and it is bad for my mental state, but now I will be here for an undisclosed period of time.

I'm clearly having some event related depression as a consequence of these events. I'm concerned it's going to trigger an episode that's going to put me in the hospital for a couple of weeks. It has before under similar circumstances.

As of this writing the mania is offsetting the severity of what has occurred, but being bipolar for 20 years I know that's not going to last long.

I'm experiencing a lot of the symptoms of depression, but as I'm manic still they are fleeting. I am suicidal. The right people are aware of this. I have no access to means to hurt myself. The compulsion too is fleeting. It surges up, I feel it real intensely, then it goes away. Still clearly manic, on the tail end.

My concern is what's going to happen over the next few days/weeks if/when the mania wears out and I start crashing. Typically for me that's depression. With the events on top of it I am even more concerned. 

I am seeing my therapist twice a week to work on this as much as possible until my insurance runs out and I can't see her anymore. 

I've called my doc, made him aware of the situation and seeing if there's any medical intervention that can occur to help offset the depression. My current meds are already at the highest level they can be at without making me sick, but as I have no responsibilities I can lay in bed sick for a couple of weeks if need be. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on any way I can get a grip on this before I end up back in the hospital or worse? I do get mixed episodes so there is a concern that the mania will mash up with the depression, then danger ensues. 

I have some exit paper work from my company I'm having a friend of my sister's look over (he's an attorney). After that I will be filling for unemployment and start the job hunt. I'm laying out a plan to keep me occupied and be productive, but as I've said I did this before and got denied unemployment for being in the hospital, so I have to stay out, even if that means I raise the risk of hurting myself which is a major issues with my depressive cycles. Mania for me isn't so bad, it's the mixed and depressive cycles that are cause for concern. 

*I do meditate as long as I can. 
*I walk shot distances (meds leave me with no energy but I'm trying)
*I'm seeing a therapist twice a week
*I take all my meds as prescribed and have for 2 years.
*I'm cutting down my sugar/bad food intake
*I worked on my resume
*I've applied for a few jobs
*I journal every day
*I talk to friends and family everyday. I don't like it, but they are concerned because of what happened last time. I can't blame them.

What else can I be doing to prevent a breakdown and end up in the hospital which will lose me unemployment, and hurt me in my upcoming divorce? If he would raise y anxiety med I could just numb out, but that's not good for dealing with an issue, just avoiding it (I have GAD as well). I don't know if there's a medical solution. I don't know if there's anything else I can do. I'm willing to try anything that has successfully helped you overcome tragedies and breakdowns. I don't have much money for obvious reasons, but I still have some because I set a bunch aide for the time I was supposed to get with my kids this week. Now that I'm not going to see them for 2 weeks I can afford something if I think it will help. 

To be clear, I'm asking what worked for you. I will try anything. I can feel it coming on like I felt the mania meaning maybe I have a week before my natural cycle overtakes me.

4720,"I made a big step. My dad emotionally abused me my whole life. I have symptoms of ptsd and suffer from anxiety. I'm on meds and go to a therapist. I have a very supportive family and friends.

He does not live with me and the rest of the family. He did the same to my mother. She got an order of protection and divorced him recently. Whenever I speak to him it's like I'm walking on eggshells. He made me grow up a nervous wreck of a human being. I'm constantly nervous.

He's very manipulative and it goes through a cycle.

Things are fine - &gt; he's manipulative - &gt; I panic - &gt; he acts like nothing happened - &gt; I give in and do nothing.. And repeat.

A few days ago, I made the decision to completely cut him off. He was bullying me (not getting into whole story). Then I texted him I am done with him stepping all over me and treating me like garbage. I am done speaking to him.

First way to become independent of him is to become independent financially.

The cellphone plan and my car are under his name.

I went to the store and got my own cell phone plan with a new number.

This weekend I am getting my own car.

I will become financially independent from him. He can't hang anything over me. And I am determined to never speak to him.

I feel guilty and highly anxious but Im assured that will pass.

I know that cutting off the root of my anxiety will ultimately help me. He is the root.


Edit :
Regarding the guilt... I have tried many many times in the past to heal my relationship with him but that abusive cycle repeats over and over. I need to break that cycle.

Several times I had to go to the bathroom just to silently cry my eyes out for 5-15 minutes.
So my mom and step dad pick me up and take me to lunch, things are okay, I’m calm and...
They tell me that they’ve somehow been spying on when I’m clocking in and out and they want me to clock out when they want to not when the managers want me to. That’s how they are-I can’t do things my way cause I’m an immature autistic 23 year old who’s only staying with them because they offered me a place to stay while I build up money and looked for housing. I’ve been pressured to take a 2nd job in October because they hated how I don’t get 40-60 hours a week at least; they don’t want me going to therapy unless it’s immediately after a work day so my therapy doesn’t conflict with their “valuable time”, and I get praised for doing things their way but scolded for doing things my way. Nothing I do pleases them in the long run; in fact I don’t even have the choice to go to the ER to get evaluated (because I’ve had suicidal like thoughts all day) or even quit one of my jobs.

2774,"My vile old employer I knew my old company was horrible when I was there but the reality of how awful it really was is just starting to hit me now. I think a lot of this is down to me having read other people's online reviews of the company which rang true with my own personal experience.

It is truly a horrid place to work. They treat their employees like pieces of machinery rather than people, and then they wonder why the turnover there is so high. My manager told me I wasn't offering them ""value for money"" in what was a very humiliating feedback session.

I didn't even really want to work there anyway because I honestly thought the company/job looked a bit rubbish compared to others in the field. But I had been rejected so many times, so I went to the interview, then got offered the job and I told them I'd think about it. I still wasn't sure I wanted to work there, so I decided to ask them for higher pay, half-hoping they'd turn me down so I wouldn't have to tell them I'd changed my mind. But they offered me the extra money, so I decided to go for it. One of the worst decisions I ever made.

The management there is terrible. After two or three weeks I was being compared unfavourably with my colleague who started in the same week, and this continued until I left a year later. I got shouted at by my manager (yes, in the first three weeks!!!) My colleagues were aggressive with me for me not working fast enough. My manager would give me strange looks and then come over and start telling me to work faster even though I was making progress, albeit slower than my colleague who I kept being compared unfavourably with. My bully of a manager would even go over to my colleague's desk and say ""Hi!!! How was your weekend?... Ohh cool!! (blah blah blah)"" and then not even say hello to me but start aggressively demanding to know how much work I'd done. I ended up working through my lunch break on some days to get the work done. I never got encouragement about my work but rather was told that I HAD to increase my work output. I found out months later that this colleague who started on the same week as me, whom I was constantly being compared with, had got a lot more experience than me. In other words, I was being being unfairly compared with this colleague and being made to feel horrible about myself just so that this vile manager could squeeze more work out of me and improve the productivity of the team or whatever.

I then got a new manager after a few months, which I was understandably extremely relieved about. It took a lot not to smile when she told us all she was leaving. At first my new manager seemed nice but after a few weeks she started displaying the same odd behaviour - not saying hello to me, giving me weird looks and being overly critical of me. Oh, and, of course, comparing me unfavourably with my colleague ad nauseum. In fact, it was her who held the aforementioned feedback session (yes, that was her saying I wasn't value for money). She also aggressively asked me why I was paid as much as I was. Why they offered me higher pay with limited experience I don't know, I guess they were desperate to get anyone through the door to complete the relentless work. She didn't even bother to read my CV prior to the meeting (IDK, maybe it wasn't available for her to view), but to aggressively demand for someone to qualify why they deserve X amount of money when they don't even know what to say to that because you're they fucking manager is downright horrible. After that I just had to work extra hours nearly every day or else risk getting kicked out. They even increased my workload to the point where I felt like I was on a rodeo bull trying to hold onto my job, with them continually increasingly the speed and me praying I didn't make an error that would lead to me getting sacked (every mistake I made, no matter how overworked, was blamed entirely on me). I eventually found myself a new job and resigned and I've been working here a while. It's only now that I realise that you can get paid well and not be treated like dirt that I'm starting to get really angry and have even been losing sleep over it, which sounds crazy since I'm not even working there anymore!!!

It was a downright miserable place to work. Blame culture and workplace bullying was everywhere, people constantly being patronised and infantilised. What a fucking scumbag company. I really hope the company kicks the bucket soon! VILE.",off_my_chest,ID27419_off_my_chest,"

5192,"Hey everyone... first time posting here I’m 17M and a senior in high school. I’m not sure why exactly I’m posting this here, it just feels like a bit of a last resort... I guess I’m seeking some kind of reassurance or empathy or something, I dunno. So for the 17 years that have been my life so far I’ve only struggled with anxiety here and there, in small doses and it’s always been manageable. Early last month, I started working at a local food establishment, my first “real” job besides counselling at a summer camp. For whatever reason, this job drove me crazy. Every night before I would have work, I could feel some sensation of drowning within me. I could feel my every heartbeat and I would just feel hopeless and powerless, it just felt like some kind of impending doom was coming my way in the form of going into work. I could usually get through it in the mornings, and after an hour or two at work I could turn off my mind and just function. Then one day I woke up, shaking, crying, unable to move much at all, feeling absolutely terrified and helpless and just in mental agony. I called in sick, and things only got worse from there. The attacks got worse with each day, until I decided (with quite a bit of convincing from my girlfriend) to finally talk to my mother about whatever’s been going on. We decided it’s best that I stop working there, and I’ve since quit (a few days ago) and have scheduled an appointment with a therapist, to hopefully get some of this sorted out. I no longer have work to freak me out, but I’ve begun to feel anxious about other things—I feel anxious about going into school, about hanging out with my friends, anxious that my relationship might be coming to an end, like every little thing that happens is some sort of sign that the end is coming, like everything is collapsing. I can’t even tell if I’m being irrational or not. I haven’t been able to eat since breakfast today, and it’s about 10:11PM right now. I just feel sick and gross and paranoid. I apologize for the super long post, I just was hoping I could talk to some people about this who might get it or could provide some comfort.

Tl;dr: Got a job that suddenly gave me violent anxiety attacks and now I’m anxious about almost everything even though I’ve since quit working there. Just trying to put myself out there and open up about this, maybe talk to some people on here about it.",anxiety,ID26654_anxiety,"

947,"The worst time of the year, again Christmas, and the time towards the new year, has been the worst time of the year again. Just like it is every year.   

My mums birthday is on the 24th, which here in Germany is already the day you celebrate and get Xmas gifts. Every year, a few days prior to Xmas my mum starts complaining about it. She complains all year about everything, but this time of year is the worst.  

She complains about money, not wanting to celebrate cause of her having so much to do. She constantly nags at my dad for us not having a lot of money, complains that when he gets home from working his 2 jobs he sometimes just wants to chill on his laptop and relax. Nothing is ever right for her.  

Yesterday they went out to look for new furniture, ever since they came back my mum has constantly been crying and complaining about money and her stressful life again.  

I'm really starting to hate her. I resent her. She is the only person in this household without a job. Not because she can't find one, but no job is good enough for her. It's always excuses, and when you tell her to find a job and other families both adults work too she just goes into rage mode and says it's not her fault or obligation.  

Now my dad has run away, he's been gone for a few hours now. He'll probably come back, I wouldn't blame him if he didn't.  

My dad is old, had a ton of injuries and is sick. He very rarely complains, but if he does my mum makes it all about her again.   

She's constantly coming to my room and yelling at me about how none of it is her fault.     

I wish she wasn't my mum. I wish my dad had divorced her long ago when my mum tried strangling me. I don't like either of them, but my mum is the person who really only cares about her life and ruins it for everyone else.

1576,"I am Human Garbage and it sucks... I am currently at work. Its my new job and I am supposed to like what I do. But its hard to enjoy anything when your human garbage.

So Ill take you back to where this all started...

Ive always been human garbage, eben in preschool!

I remember my first day at school, I bit someone because I was upset that they started talking to me and then taken to someone else... I know shitty but I was a kid right? 
Well no, I mean I was but it didn't stop after getting out of preschool. I may not have bitten anyone anymore, but I guess Ihm just wired? It was always hard for me to make friends and even if I did manage to make a friend it was even harder to keep them. Now for a bit of info about myself, I am not ugly nor do I look wired. There is nothing really wrong with me as such, I don't smell and I don't have a wired voice so nothing that would turn anyone away like that.
But anytime I ever had friends it was like they where either embarrassed to be my friend or I had to basically ""pay"" them to stay my ""friend"". Meaning I would give them my toys I would never say no to anything and I would let them do whatever they want kind of...

But none the less it was still hard to have a friend that wants to be my real genuine friend. I never was one of the popular girls and I was always more of an outsider in every situation and place I would go. Even being one of the best a sports didn't help me or joining any groups that popular kids would join.

So that went on, till I reached Highschool, but there the same thing repeated it self it seemed, guys would like me and then out of nowhere they wouldn't anymore I would have a great best friend and then I wouldn't the next day. 
Now you may be thinking well did she have enemies? Nope.
Just an outcast for no reason... I didn't even fit in with the obvious outcasts, because even they had their own group of friends...

So now I am an adult and I have 1 ""friend"" and a boyfriend, who I lie to and tell him I have tons of friends, I mean how would he know, when in reality I sit by myself and just surf Instagram and cry myself to sleep.

In order to seem interesting to people I lie in hopes that maybe someone will like me and yes even when I try to be myself and tell the truth (nothing major) there is still no interest. and I spend another day eating lunch by myself at work in the toilets.


So I have come to the conclusion that I am human garbage and I am just not meant to be on earth, maybe I was a mistake I mean I know I wasnt planned (haha...) So I am turning to reddit in hopes that someone will read this and ""help"" me.
Because I don't want to be alone and I just want someone who cares about me as much as I care about them, who has the same interests as me and understands me.

I feel like something is really wrong with me and I'm deeply horrified that I'll never feel like a human being. I get overwhelmed with everything and I don't know why. I don't want to die. I just want to be somewhere far away from where I am.

I'm failing my college classes, all of them. I don't know. I just stopped going. My parents don't know. I don't care anymore. For a few days I feel good and carefree and blow off all my shit to have fun, but then a few days after I can't get over how I'm such a fuck-up, but I can't pull myself out. I can't focus on anything.

I've never had a job and I feel like a loser admitting that. I feel so unstable that I'm having a meltdown about going about it. I have no clue what I'm doing.

I keep seeing and smelling things in nature that keep reminding me of when I was a kid and I felt so healthy. Now I just feel exhausted and so estranged from everyone around me. I just feel so emotionally raw and then numb a lot. When I was a kid my mother choked my brother right in front of me, my vision got all fuzzy and I just stared back at my DS and continued playing. It's a really weird emotion. I panicked the other day and just grabbed my shit and fled the house and peeled out of there. When I panic, I just lose control of my limbs and mouth, then my vision distorts.

I've been around so many fights in my house. I get anxious that one of my family members is going to just pull a knife out and stab me to death. I grew up thinking about my dad losing his mind because of all the fights and then shooting us all down. I've started to cut myself again recently. I feel so tense all the time, I'm going to lose it.

595,"depression and self pity are destroying me (sorry for the length) No idea how long this is gonna be but we'll see.

I've been depressed verging on two years now.  I can't even go once a day anymore without feeling like a complete piece of shit.  i'm a disappointment to my dad and it's not getting any better.  We fight weekly or more.  i'm in my first semester at college and i don't think i've ever cared about my future or my life less.  i don't have anything i want to study and nothing i want to do for a living besides sit and feel sorry for myself.  i could care less about my grades or my professors.  i was top of my class all of high school but i was a dumb ass and ruined my grades the final semester because i was starting the spiral i'm in right now.  i'm just a wreck.  i don't feel like anything i do can make this better cause of the situation i'm in.  i feel useless.  i think all the time about how worthless i am, how i'm not passionate about any talents that would get me a career, how i have so many mental conditions or whatever that i'm too fucked up for anyone to truly want to get close to me.  i hate myself.  i don't see any future for myself at all.  I'm 19 and i still haven't even gotten a car or my license because i don't feel confident enough to take the test.  i have yet to have a single job.  i very often think that i won't let myself make it to 25 or 30 because i'll have proven myself a failure by that point and i won't have anything to live for.  i'm always the last option, the person everyone backs off from once they get to know me. 

i feel like i've only had one girl ever actually care about the ""true me,"" whatever the fuck that means.  fell in love with her senior year, we got super emotionally intimate but she wanted to stay as close friends instead of having something.  hurts every time i talk to her.  can't feel anything else when talking to other women; it just feels like a shadow of what i felt for her.

my dad had super high expectations for me.  he wanted me to go to a very nice college on preferably a full or almost full ride on scholarships and become this workaholic money earning machine so he could be ""proud of me.""  i can't stand him now.  i deliberately act on the opposite of his advice or instructions, and nowadays i will deliberately not do something just because he wants me to do it.  nothing he does towards me seems to be out of affection for his son; he just wants to mold me into a model upper middle class citizen so he can tout me to his other pilots when he goes to work.  he's pretty much devoid of emotion towards me.  i feel like he's a robot often.  he is an extreme workaholic that's never had problems with goals, motivation, getting what he wants.  in fact, the only things in his life that could be seen as going wrong are things about me/related to me/me in general.

i haven't been in touch with my mother for 2.5 years now.  she accused me of physically assaulting and robbing her the last time we saw each other as mother and son.  i don't miss her, nor do i believe her absence from my life is the reason for any of this.  my childhood with her can only be described as extremely toxic and emotionally abusive.  however i do certainly believe that some of my current mental problems come from the insane amounts of dysfunction from my upbringing.

any confidence or positive self-image i had in the past is beyond completely ruined.  i can only see negative things about myself now.  my dad has spent the last year telling me how pathetic and immature i am and that if i don't become an entirely different person i'll never be worth anything.  i never thought of myself as attractive but now i almost can't look at myself.  i'm short and it affects me now hundreds of times more than it used to, because i know i'm forever gonna be stuck at 5'6"" while almost everyone i know is at least 4 or 5 inches taller than me if not more.  

i've been an outcast in varying shapes and sizes most of my life.  it started with horrific levels of bullying in middle school, and i've never felt very accepted since.  i'm the outsider looking in.  i'm the one who everyone either forgets to invite or intentionally doesn't. 
i keep in touch with almost nobody i used to.  pretty much all of my good friends have left town and are enjoying their lives to the fullest.  most of the friendships i've had over the years feel superficial at best.  if anyone actually did seem close to me and think i was worth being close to, i feel like it's because they don't know how truly fucked up of a person i am. there's no place where i'm wanted, and almost nobody would care if i suddenly died.  

in fact if i'm honest, i'm half amazed i haven't grown more of a self-harm habit or suicidal tendencies.  i have suicidal thoughts nowadays, sure, but for whatever reason i'm not very keen on actually intentionally harming myself, no matter my mood.  i can tell i'm getting closer to that point though.

whether or not i expressed them here, i have thoughts like this regarding pretty much every aspect of my life.  this isn't everything wrong, i'm sure, but it's a big part of it.  i'm sure the more i sat here the more i could come up with but whatever.  i'm not entirely sure what i'm asking for or getting out of writing this.  i know the self pity is a self fulfilling destructive spiral but i don't feel like i can do anything about it.  maybe it's a cry for help or just a way to vent.  i don't know.  don't have much more to say at the moment though so guess i'll wrap it up here.",depression,ID28441_depression,"

It's very serious and I have my reasons.
My family is very unstable financially.
Ultimately it led to me isolating myself from every single person  and activity in my life.
I became a nobody and after a point no one really ( from my friend circle) asked about me, texted me or called me ( this went for about 6months).
Yesterday I got back in touch with a couple of my friends and till now they knew that something was off in my life but they didn't ask me anything about it( I guess they didn't really know how to approach me).
My depression and suicidal ideation had a big impact on my education and I landed up in a really bad college..... They joked about how I was already an unsuccessful person / a failure in life because I was studying in one of the worst colleges and they are actually going to the best colleges the state has to offer.
I'm only 19 and 
I know that small talk like this is insignificant and holds no value  because i have a lot of time left to do something but I cannot get over it.
It feels awful and to make things worse, all of them have their pockets full with their dads money.
They probably don't have to work as hard as I do and they will always be secure because of their wealth.

For some backstory I do have a therapist, but lately I’ve only been taking more and more steps backward from getting better.
All I know of who I am is this: 

-I’m too afraid of being hurt again to make real connections with anyone, even family.

-I overemphasize rationality over emotion in a subconscious undertaking to erase my feelings; I feel inhuman, like a machine. (also causing me to create bulleted lists explaining my life)

-I just graduated highschool and I can already feel myself withering away and being held back by the same nagging questions.

-I want nothing, I have no goals, no ideas of a destination. Not even a far fetched dream I can whistfully grasp at and half-heartedly believe to be possible.

Well, there is actually one thing that I want though. To dream that I have a shot at having a purpose, I know it’s impossible though. In my mind I’ve convinced myself that It is impossible. 

I feel nothing and I am nothing and I’ll die nothing. 

I’ve been thinking of death a lot lately, and each time it gets more comforting.

4417,"Life is too empty without work/romance/family/social contact I wish I had gone through with my plan to hang myself on NYE. It just feels like there is not enough in life to make it worth the effort.

I am on disability pension and nearly every day just consists of trying to get my own laundry and cooking and cleaning done. My medical problems are getting worse and it probably won't be long before I need outside help to do those things. There is virtually no chance I will be able to do a worthwhile or fulfilling job.

I have only ever had one partner, she was violent and emotionally and financially abusive but having a companion made it worthwhile, given how lonely I was before (and since). I doubt I will be able to find someone willing to date a disabled and unemployed man but even then my trauma from being beaten by my ex-wife wouldn't let it work.

I only have social contact about 3-4 times a month - mostly through my disability support group, occasionally there is a meetup I can go to. I don't have many friends and none of them see me regularly. Some of them disassociated from me because when my wife was abusive they took me for the abuser because gender. Some of them live far away, mostly they are just too busy to care.

I've been trying to immerse myself in things I find fun and interesting but it's not enough to deal with the loneliness. Hobbies like gaming and reading are fun diversions but it doesn't meet my need to be with others. It feels like I'm living out my retirement at 35. Without a partner or a career or a real social life it isn't worth living.

Also, this is taking quite a bit of energy, but I expect we've all understand that. 

After 20 years of something that may or may not have been depression, things have gotten much worse in the last 3-5 years. My last two jobs drove me to daytime drinking and chest pains enough to worry a doctor respectively. (the drinking is done, and they weren't at the same time) Even thinking about my last job while trying to put a resume together was enough to give me chest pains for a year. 

Since then a very close individual has passed away and I've had massive professional setbacks. This is made worse by seeking mental help being a major way to get locked out of my field. (No reason to disagree about how it's illegal, the government endorses the practice. Those in the fields in question understand)

I go through this simply to show the costs of going this far. 

I have no income, apparently don't qualify for disability even if physically incapable of work, am currently on food stamps / government health care, and owe two months of utilities. My landlord is kind enough to take goods in trade for the time being, but that won't last long. 

I can't afford to travel for any mental help, I am still unwilling to do the local NAMI ""you must register for everything!"" events just to be lectured at, and none of the local doctors I've found accept government insurance plans. 

Anyone have any ideas? Working for myself was an option until my sales dried up to a net loss every month. 

But at least I have food stamps. As someone who has spent two months eating very little of whatever I could find, regardless of age, I appreciate having a steady supply of food. I just want to be clear how thankful I am for that. ",depression,ID41443_depression,"

Laid off 3 months ago from good job, no others like it in the area. Divorced, he doesn’t talk to his kids, moved across country. Last guy I fell for started it all based on lies and it’ll never be more than friendship now. I understand why he lied. Had to move from awesome 3 bedroom house I’d rented for me and kids when ex left, that I honestly never could afford. Know I made right decisions but feel like a failure, keep crying, worked my ass off on moving and not getting deposit back. Kids are healthy. Family loves me. Taking 2 antidepressants, have klonopin for the bad days. Just quit smoking pot to help with the job hunt but now it’s not dulling the pain anymore. I was abusing it. Hiding from everything, even my kids. I know I’m taking the right steps. I’ve started doing 30 minutes of cardio 5x a week, and it usually involves me yelling at the universe “I’m doing this for me!!!” But still, I feel helpless. Moronic. Naive. Not good enough. I can have a bad day and know it’ll pass, but since hospitalized for thoughtcrimes in July, anytime I have more than one anxiety attack in a day I start to panic about having to go back. I’m whining. I know there’s hope, that I’ll assimilate to new living arrangements. I had super unhealthy coping mechanisms (way too much weed, fucking anyone who wanted) and I’ve addressed those. Understood where they came from. Replaced them. But still, I cry. Still, I hate this depression and the genetics that gifted me with it. I hurt. And I feel weak. And not good enough.

5294,"Want to escape my own body + Get away from Everything that is familiar (existential) I am getting a weird feeling right now. I feel like I'm going insane because my memories/what I know make me feel trapped, it makes me realize how evrrything is limited. It's freaking me out so much right now. Life is so limited. I don't want to become like people I have known. 

This was triggered yesterday, when I talked to my grandma on the phone. I don't call her often, but she kept talking about everyone in the family, and what they are becoming (Im not too close to most of my family I guess). It seems like they haven't evolved. They stay in the same little town, marry someone they've met in middle school, and have 4 children by the age of 25.  But I realize everyone I met is like that. They work a boring job they don't like. They live in the same house until they die. 

It's so limited. It makes me panic. Life is too limited. It seems like people usually panic over novelty, but right now everything I know is making me panic. It feels too real, too predictable, like there's no room for evolution. I'm scared of being normal, but I realize I'm just human and there's only so much I can do.

I have felt it before in less severe ways and it's caused me to send these messages pouring all my negative thoughts out which have really harmed my relationships (my best friend pretty much hates me and only just tolerates me now)

I felt that force again today and I ended up writing a suicide note. Hopefully nobody finds it. I don't have any intentions of comitting suicide yet but I still think about it loads.

2908,"How to come to terms with childhood trauma and how to go about repairing it? I have had severe anxiety and attachment issues since I can remember. Then again, my childhood before everything fell apart is a blur now.

I can't get close to anyone. The one person I have gotten close to I'm borderline obsessively close to them. I get viciously overprotective of him, hurt and backstabbed feeling when he goes out, and angry when other people try to get close to him, as if he's mine or something. Other people I just can't get close to. I shove them away and I subconsciously refuse to trust them, and I sort of traced this all back to how I was abandoned a lot as a child through no fault of anyone. (Long story - brother got cancer, mother kind of ignored me due to brother being dying and all, sister(only person I could talk to)  ran away from home due to stress and love and stuff.)

The other issue being that I can't deal with being yelled at by someone above me. It sends me into a series of wildly erratic panic attacks, hysteria and snottiness as if I were a 5 year old being grounded.
Things like my boyfriends father yelling at me, or a boss/teacher/etc make me pinch the back of my hand until it bleeds or bite my tongue until it's numb etc to try to distract myself from the onset of anxiety and I can't stop it happening. Thanks dad, loved living with you.


My question is - I can see the root of these issues, how do I come to terms with childhood trauma and start repairing myself?

Then i always end up back in the same situation. Feeling the same or worse. Idk what to do. I want to do something that not only would benefit myself but maybe other who feel the same way?

They can send it anonymously and i won’t reference a name and me and my audience can just talk about it and see if we can cheer up the individual. Like the one thing that would cheer me up when I’m depressed would be helping out others. Makes me feel worth it knowing that I can get someone out of a similar funk Im feeling.

2075,"I quit my job (t/w ableist slurs, self harm, body image) And honestly it was the most amazing feeling in the world. 

I spent two years working at functions and events ballroom, working 12 to 14 hour shifts at times, while getting yelled at and verbally abused by my boss/owner of the venue.

The team were frequently called ""sp*stics"", ""fucksticks"" and ""ret*rds"", and he would often imply that we were disposable. 

When I was living in my van i was interrogated by my boss who called me into the office after one of the guests (his cousin) complained that the ""bar woman kept disappearing into some van"" - when I was in there literally twice (once on my 15 min break and once on my smoko) 
He then asked me to park next to the dumpsters behind the building instead of the staff carpark. 

When my colleague quit she asked me to bring her paycheck because we both lived in the same area on the other side of town from work so it was more convenient. They argued it for 3 weeks with her before finally giving in, and the reason behind it was apparently because ""how do you know you can trust her(me)"" 

I booked, and organized countless venue tours for the business and was promised a commision that I never saw. 

He asked me to provide personal and sensitive information from a friend of mine who worked for liquor licensing about other venues. 

He made frequent comments on my weight despite telling him multiple times it made me uncomfortable.

I had a complaint from one of the guests who came up to me and said ""hey, i dont know who to talk to about this, but someone who appears to be management seem to continuously bark orders at the staff like dogs""...
 
There's more shit. But in the end, my breaking point was when all of those negative words and hurtful comments started slowly seeping into my personal life and my relationship. I often looked at myself and hated myself for anything i did. Or didn't do anything because everything i did was wrong. I started abusing myself, cutting myself and ended up in hospital. He tore through my self esteem, and i cared too much about the other staff to leave until it quite literally almost killed me. 

I rockstarred at a club bar one night and they couldn't stop saying how grateful they were that i could come in at such short notice and told me how much I had helped and I realized, my boss hasn't thanked me once. For anything. And I bent over backwards for him.

It made me realize I was worth more. That I am more, and that I deserve better. That it wasn't actually me that had the problem. He did. And I couldn't change how he felt about me, and it wasn't my responsibility to try.

4220,"Manic GF is Falling for a guy across the country, What do? Posted before about this situation, just really don't know how to be the best partner to my GF who is having her first strong hypomanic episode. She doesn't currently see me as anything more than a friend (an annoying one at that because she is standoffish or short with me and only me) which is why she wanted us to break.

The guy she started talking on a mental illness discord has already reciprocated her interest in him, and I think she's beginning to fall for him. From what I've heard about him and from how he personally has treated me in Dms, he has narcissistic BPD and is also quite an asshole. He acts like a chill guy and doesn't play up much when talking to me, though when i acknowledged that she had feelings for him (knowing he already knew and that he knew she was manic), he pretty much responded with ""sucks for you.""

From his online appearance, he likes to play League of Legends (which he's been banned from permanently three times), likes to play D&amp;D (was kicked from his last group unanimously), and was even paranoid that one of her friends was going to try something with her since he's over the border by a thousand miles. Obviously she is becoming infatuated with him and trying to find time to do things with him during a week she claimed she wanted to herself.

I'm at my wit's end trying to figure out how to handle this, especially since I want to be there for her through this and when she crashes afterwards. But that's hard to do when you can tell your significant other thinks of you as an acquaintance instead of the best friends you used to be or at least thought you were.

3946,"Sorry... I don't know why I am doing this... I don't want to die. I just don't have the will to live. I am in pain. Physical, mental, existential. I am barely alive anymore. I lose more of myself each day.

But I know life is worth living even now. I guess while I am not sharing much I just wanted to say something. 

I am not well. The pressure to live is immense. The world and even those I care about make me feel so guilty for feeling how I do. I want to live like I did before everything happened. I want to triumph over this and find a way to be.

But I can't. My health is not going to improve only decline. My memories will continue to fade. My heart continues to torture me. And I find myself a coward unable to face up to it when it happens this early in my life.

And even though in moments of weakness my mind tries to convince me to end it all I refuse to accept that. I don't want to die. But I do nothing to save myself anymore.

I seek no treatments. I don't bathe or take care of myself. I can barely focus on the things around me.

But for the barest moments between the pain I still find moments that remind me how much I love the world and people and things in it. No matter how many times they disappoint me I look for the good and try to help them with their faults.

But they handle their problems. I don't seem to be able to do that anymore. Perhaps I never did. 

I always tried to be strong and self-reliant and there when others need me. So I wouldn't be a burden.

Now I am none of those things. I am a crippled, broken vanishing thing. Even saying that makes me hate the pity party I sound like I am evoking. But I don't want to be completely alone. Though I worry others who visit or care for me do so out of pity or something else. I also don't like the pain I see in them when I keep changing into someone else before them.

Perhaps I am being selfish. But I am scared. I keep having to chase away thoughts of wanting not to wake up the next morning. And I can't accept forcing that conclusion.

But I am not preventing it. I am not eating right. I am not exercising. I am not even bathing properly or doing other hygiene rituals.

I know it is just a slower form of suicide. I am wrong to not try. I am wrong to be a coward. I even know it is wrong for me to believe that I can protect others and I am selfish.

But I am not wrong on one thing. Life is worth living. Even now.

I may not seem to be able to see it clearly anymore but I refuse to believe that pain invalidates life.

I love every moment I live. I am grateful even now for my life.

I am scared though. I don't want to die. But I can't seem to will myself to live anymore.

I can't find a good reason to continue. But there is no reason to quit other than the pain in all its forms.

I guess the only purpose I currently have is to find purpose with the time I have left.

I guess I just wanted to clear my head.

I can STILL hear that BS even with earplugs - and I have glue ear so it's not like my hearing is sensitive, it's usually slightly muffled as it is.

He wakes up at 12 PM and goes to sleep no earlier than 12 - 1 AM, being obnoxiously loud in the process as if it were 12 PM.
I have heart problems and when they act up I can get very sick and my doctor and therapist explicitly stated I needed more relaxation and rest, but how the heck can I relax when every few seconds I hear that BS? I can also here him banging in his room.
My mother doesn't give a crap and is outside all the time. She doesn't bother to take him to a doctor so they can drug some sense into him and acts like I'm nuts or irrational because I want to relax and 1 AM. IN. THE. MORNING!

If I get home from work at 5 PM, then I'm going to have to deal with 7 HOURS of acoustic torture BS before I can even BEGIN to relax. It takes me a few hours to get that missing relaxation just so I can fall asleep.

You may say just listen to music etc. I do! I can still hear that shit through my headphones and it distracts the hell out of me. I can't even do basic hobbies properly!! 

He has a cold right now and I know it sounds terrible, but I'm HOPING he gets laryngitis so he can shut the F up for a bit and I can have some daytime relaxation which I haven't had for months and months. ",off_my_chest,ID3603_off_my_chest,"

2924,"Lexapro Side Effects My doctor started me on Lexapro (Escitalopram) last week for GAD, SA and MDD. Last year I took Prozac for about a month but it made me physically ill (nauseous, dizzy, foggy)and unable to get out of bed so I stopped. With Lexapro I haven't been feeling sick at all, but my appetite has decreased a lot, I have trouble falling asleep at a reasonable hour and I am so irritable.

Last night I yelled at my partner to go away multiple times while sobbing and feeling just plain hurt and angry. We have been having some issues related to my declining health and some big bumps in the road that have happened in the last 8 months but I've never really reacted this way before with him, definitely not without an obvious cause, I haven't acted like this since I was a young teen. I also even told my dog to go away and normally we always snuggle and I never want her to leave my side. I live with my partner so obviously, it can't continue like this, for everyone's sake.

As far as my appetite goes, I suffered from anorexia throughout most of high school and although I am at a healthy weight and no longer calorie count, I'm concerned the loss in appetite will spark some old bad habits and send me back into that spiral. I still carry some fairly bad body dysmorphia and low self-esteem.
Has anyone taken this medication before or have had similar experiences with SSRIs? When does it go away (if ever)? Or just some support?

I've pushed away most of my friends and my partner is still upset about last night so I'm too anxious about bothering him and for him to feel like I'm blaming my actions on mental health AGAIN (this may not be what he thinks but I'm very paranoid, especially when it comes to people/relationships). I really have no one I'm comfortable enough talking to about my health, I've always felt so embarrassed about it and like people would think I want attention or I'm using it to act out/ be a garbage person.

It pushed me over the edge and I got in to see my doctor after the funeral to get on meds. Honestly, my entire body has been aching ever since he passed. From my toes all the way up into my teeth, I hurt. Some days it's worse, but it's always there.

3185,"My feelings Let me preface my comments in by saying I am expressing myself and I am not looking for advice,  I'm just venting. 

Well my life is all about avoiding,  isolation,  trips to the park,  working,  anxiety, depression,  rage,  confusion,  melancholy,  insanity,  manic behavior,  porn,  and irrational mental journeys. 

I often feel waves of engulfed fear in my system.  For some reason fear is my kryptonite.  I feel powerless and I noticed in 2017 something happened to me where I got engrossed into fear.  It was like something catastrophic happened in my brain and fear latched itself on me.  At night my fears run rampant. 

My irrational mind is just naturally irrational.  Most of my thoughts arent of the norm.  I researched hundreds of homicides,  suicides,  murder suicides,  etc.   I developed feelings for the deceased and often think I am one of their friends. I always have this irrational fear that something catastrophic will occur in my life and I will be totally obliterated as a result.  

I experience melancholy and have been for over a decade. Its severe and I usually swim in it.  I live inside my thoughts so melancholy is like my adventure.  Some people go to the gym and do things while I sit and travel inside my mind and thoughts.  

I go through dangerous feelings of rage from a past incident.  Its been two years but still I have a dangerous ideation. 

I can be depressed all day if I really want to.  I think I have a depression that is best described as a long novel. Its full of ma y meanings and doesn't appear to have a cut off limit. 

I feel like I am not cut out for this world.  People need to face their fears,  deal with the blows of life,  manage through adversity,  be mature,  change,  grow,  accept new challenges and difficulty.  I cannot.  I tried with a relationship and failed miserably.  Then I ended it but ran back because of the fear,  then acted a certain way so now I'm hated by my actions. I still dream about her.  People tell me I need to move on which is right but I can't erase her from my memory.  As long as I don't contact the person then I am fine.  After the relationship is when I became suicidal.  I made three attempts and too afraid to try for a fourth time.  My body and heart was strong.  I think my second attempt should had killed me or at least damaged something.  I told God that if I'm still a live then I'll just drift my way to the grave.  I tried holding on various ways by listening to peaceful Indian music,  listening to mystics like sadhguru,  krishnamurti,  osho,  and listening to a few buddhist monk speeches.  I even had some spiritual moments in which I felt at peace but my mind snaps back to the default. 

I don't spend time with friends.  I deserted all them years ago.  I don't spend time with family.  I only talk to my mom and dad.  I sometimes write my brother that is in prison.  I feel like I just can't give myself to them.  If I couldn't give myself to a beautiful Mexican woman then I sure as he can't do with family.  I don't wanna get close to anyone.  

My life feels hopeless because I don't want to complete this 60 to 80 year stretch that we all call life.  I don't wanna be miserable or facing the loop thoughts of what I did in the past.  I don't wanna stress anymore.  I dont want to keep experiencing this rat race.  I don't want to keep experiencing rage and irrational feelings.  I don't wanna manage these issues.  I don't wanna manage my behavior.  I don't wanna manage my feelings.  I don't wanna manage any problems from the past.  I feel like if my memory was knocked out then I'd feel good.  To not remember screwing up things or feeling homicidal would be great.  All my mind will do is harbor in these experiences and replay them in my head everyday.  It is the most consistent thing about me that I do not feel proud of.  I see why Laura Vanessa Nunes took her life.  I'm sorry for the rant but I miss some of the old figments of me.  I miss when I was a kid and lived in fantasy.  I dont like this adult life.  I dont wanna change every fiber in my being.  I dont want to grow up and grow balls.  I rather grow the other thing.  I dont wanna face my fears.  I dont want to put myself out there.  I don't want to get a better job.  I don't want friends.  I don't want a better life.  All I want is peace.

Every day I become more and more attracted to females, but the problem is that I'm in a brilliant, amazing relationship with a guy. He can't be faulted... Which is why I feel so terrible that I keep feeling attracted to girls. I've even made a move on one of my straight female friends, which ended really badly. When we were drunk, asked her to kiss me and she told me I was being crazy and to go to sleep. 

But anyway, that's a tangent. 

I want to suggest a threesome to my boyfriend (who is receptive to the idea) but I'm scared that if I like it, I will want to stay with girls. But I am scared that I might not like it because I'll become jealous about my boyfriend being with another girl in front of me.

I basically just feel so stupid, and petty, and like I know nothing about these feelings I've been trying to suppress since I was a young teenage girl, and now I'm older and in a committed relationship, my sexual feelings are bursting at the seams.

1301,"Dark Thoughts... 😱

I moved this summer. Not far -- just to another neighborhood -- but it was still immensely stressful. I had no choice, and I live in a brutal real estate market. Luckily, I found a place in time. But, IT was really upsetting, and I'd even go so far as to say traumatic. I was also deducted a big chunk of my damage deposit. I haven't really recovered yet emotionally.

Sunday my roommate told me he was offered a job and has to move out. Not sure when yet, but it will be sometime in the new year. More details to follow... but this means I either need to have the lease transfered into my name and find another roommate, and have the stress of managing that and managing the bills, or, move again. The latter is probably the best option for a lot of reasons. Our apartment is dirty (it was dirty when I moved in) and I know I'll get my deposit back this time if I move, since I can make my room tip top clean no problem. There is also a broken washing machine on our balcony that I don't want to have the job of getting rid of, if the lease is in my name. So I should move. It's very upsetting.

On top of this, I got a hospital bill that I did not know I was getting/had been told my insurance was covering. It's steep: $600. I can pay it, but it just, really is upsetting.

I'm not in the happiest place, to put it lightly. I'm internalizing all of this, and it's tying back to all the mistakes I've made that lead to my hospitalization almost a year ago, and the reasons why I had to move to where I live now.

I dont think Ill actually do it tonight or anytime too soon (kill myself I mean), but having it written out gives me comfort whether I do it or not. At this point, Its probably not, but I feel like the potential of it happening is stronger than ever before. If not to day then eventually. I grabbed a spare notebook and just started writing my feelings and small letters to the different people in my life. The whole reason for it is cause I very well may have just fucked up my friendship with my best friend. She's been there for years through my ups and downs and I developed a crush on her because of it. One that never went away and wasnt mutual. Some of those low points involve that crush including a recent argument we've had. Its not the first time weve had the argument. Its my fault like its always been. Ive been a crummy friend and this time the consequences are all too real. I dont blame her. She has every right to end it.  Knowing what Ive done and the thought of our friendship ending, it makes me feel physically sick and empty. 6+ years of friendship could be wiped out cause I was too selfish to change. This time was the one that opened up my eyes and it could be too late to do anything about it. Im a piece of shit and I deserve the consequences, but its still eating me up. Even if I do soldier on, i feel like Ill just be empty. A husk. I don't even know what I wamt to really say at this point. Ill know tomorrow what she decides, but my mind for the time being is just swirling. I even bought her christmas gift todat when she sent me a novel of how I made her feel.

The hard part is as an ESL ALT (Assistant Language Teacher), I'm taking on a multitude of schools (7 to be exact) from leaving predecessors. Issue being my preds were literally 5 years into their jobs with incoming teaching experience. I'm almost a year out of college with none bar tutoring. My preds were also fantastic teachers whose experience basically meant that teachers could relax when planning classes cause they had ideas and games aplenty. I have...none of that. So now my teachers that I work with are expecting me to keep up the same magnitude of efficiency that these 5th years had at the end of their term. I'm slowly drowning here because God forbid I experience any grievances or physical signs of discomfort in this damn culture. 

Don't get me wrong, I really do love my job. Working with young people is fun because I like seeing how they grow and develop and what lessons they learn. It's an environment that's really interesting to me. Unfortunatelty, the high expectations are constantly weighing down on me. Literally started binge eating from the stress, little sleep because I panic at the thought of going to some of my schools, and effectively became a shut-in because I'm stuck in the simultaneous ideas of ""If you have time to go out and socialize, you have time to get better at your job, trash,"" and ""What's the point if every earnest attempt is just failure; they're just gonna shit all over what you come up with again, so might as well stay in bed.""

248,"Grieving Spouse Suicide As the surviving spouse of a successful recent suicide, I am having some difficulty reconciling my emotions with returning to daily life.

I took two weeks off of work, but have gone back. Some days are better than others, some days are unbearable. Today, I opted to stay home without pay after multiple bouts of tears last night and this morning. I've mostly been able to keep the tears under control at work, but my anxiety is sky high at times while my desire to actually be at work is at rock bottom.

The tears will likely take care of themselves with time, but lately I am having a really difficult time with tolerating work due to the anxiety. It doesn't help that the nature of my work is often dynamic and can result in me being forced to work extra hours I really don't want at this time, facing customers who may be grumpy themselves if not totally irate.

So I guess what I am looking for is some tips to help deal with the anxiety. It just feels like a struggle to be there, and like I am at risk of losing my job if that anxiety bubbles up into a negative interaction with a customer.

I can take additional time off from work, but only under unpaid FMLA if I am treating for depression, which I am not. For stigmatic reasons, I'd rather not go that route.

I am not suicidal or even unable to function in ways outside of my work issues, though the anxiety is always present if significantly reduced.

3059,"Good morning, it's 4:33 am for me Good morning.

It’s 4:16 am at the time I started writing this.

My name is Toods and I am 20 years old. I have been abused mentally and emotionally all of my life. I was sexually assaulted 6 different times by close family friends, bullied heavily throughout my schoolcareer, and was used as a therapist by literally everybody I had ever met because I was ‘so mature for my age’ and had ‘great advice to give’.

After graduating high school and becoming stagnant for two years afterwards, seeing as I didn’t get into college nor did I have any plans for life after high school, I got to raise a dog that my father bought on a whim. I self harmed for the first time when I was 18. I scratched my nails against the back of my hand until I tore into my skin. I told my mother immediately afterwards. Upon having my father find out, the first thing he told me was ‘That’s fucking stupid.’

I do not like my father.

I was eight when he emotionally abandoned me. That was when I was diagnosed with anxiety due to an incident that happened with me messing my pants and not having any control over it. Overall it was a really bad day. I got therapy for it.

It didn’t help.

In the 5th grade I was groped by my brother’s ex best friend. He was thirteen at the time. I was ten. He knew what he was doing. He then groomed me into roleplaying extremely explicit sexual messages with him until I was 12.

He then shoved my hand down his pants and forced me to give him a handjob while he groped me in September of that year. 

I immediately told my mother.

I had numerous therapists throughout my life and for some reason it’s just starting to hit me right now. Back in August I finally moved out of my abusive home and into an apartment with my brother and our best friend. It was so weird not having to wake up and have the dishes done before my father came home- or cringing from someone speaking to me- or not flinching when the front door opened and someone walked down the hall.

Upon graduating from HS I got a psychiatrist. I’ve had him for two years. I love him and he’s made me realize all of these things that… I didn’t notice before.  I am medicated. I have weekly visits with him. I’m in a non toxic environment, yet I feel as though I’m getting worse and worse.

I self harmed tonight by cutting. I mutilated a shaving razor with a pair of scissors to get out said razors and then I cut myself with it. It’s less than a centimeter long. 

I’m so tired. I’ve just been getting worse. I have night terrors so bad I wake up crying, shaking, sweating, and now recently, wetting myself. I’m both hyper sexual and sex repulsed. At times I’ll self harm by masturbating until I’m sore and bleeding. I’m just so fucking tired.

There are  times where I want to die so fucking badly but I can’t. I can’t because I would hurt so many other people and I couldn’t do that to them. Yet I’m stuck here in this fucking shell of a body. I don’t feel anything other than depression. I don’t feel joy or excitement or happiness. Everyday I oversleep and have some sort of depression episode. 

When I meet new people I overshare. I didn’t realize I did this until my girlfriend told me. I didn’t realize I was making people uncomfortable.

I’m so fucking tired.
I’m rambling.
I don’t want to emit myself to a hospital.

I’m so fucking tired but it’s a type of tired that sleep can’t fix. My body aches and I constantly cry. I stay up at night crying and at times I can’t sleep because of my night terrors. I have a group of friends and a brother and mother that love me. I know they do. They tell me this often. I have a room in my Discord chat where we post negative stuff and I just keep posting negative after negative thing.

It gets even worse because as an aspiring artist I can’t just seem to do anything right in my own eyes. I know I’m young. I know I’m allowed to make mistakes but… every time I do make a mistake it makes me so fucking tired.

I’m fucking tired.

I’m not doing well tonight. I threw out the razors and decided I should post here. It’s 4:32. I shouldn’t have self harm ‘goals’. My psychiatrist is out until Janurary thanks to the holidays. 

Either way. Good morning. I can’t sleep and I don’t want to sleep. I want to die.

The depression I’m experiencing has been a slow onset over a few weeks, but has been really bad. My boyfriend says I’ve been fucked since New Years, idk know if I believe that, maybe. I feel so god awful alone. I haven’t felt this alone in such a long time, and my boyfriend just took me to pick out my engagement ring. My boyfriend doesn’t “get” this sort of stuff and doesn’t even try, but I’ve isolated myself so badly he’s all I’ve got to talk to (I’m convinced no one else cares, and I’m convinced he doesn’t want to put up with my shit anyways). He gets very mad. I usually have to beg him to listen, then when he finally does, he’ll say things like “don’t do that” “just do what you have to do”. I try to talk to him but he says all I do is tell him what he does wrong, which in my opinion isn’t accurate, my only gripe with our relationship has been communication and always has been. We’re bad at it together.

I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Everything is such a fucking chore. I hate going to university (I’m in my mid twenties) because I feel so alone. Like those movie scenes where the person is standing still, but there are thousands of people moving around them very quickly. Like I know I don’t have anything in common with the kids at school, but since the depression has onset it’s only magnified how utterly alone I feel.

I can’t let go of the feeling that I fuck everything up. I have to beg my boyfriend to listen to me and that’s always a fight. I’ve missed assignments in school and I feel like I’m trashing it (really though, nothing major, not in danger of failing). I’m just a piece of shit, the same piece of shit I’ve always been. I ruin every good thing I touch.

I wish I didn’t care that I had to beg him to care about me sometimes, I think he is just more aloof than I am at any given time. I wish I could care less.

In February it will have been a year since I was diagnosed after about 10 years of struggling on my own and shitty psychiatrists. I’m 22 years old and days ago got out of a 5 year relationship mostly because of my poor mental health.

I experience rage frequently and always seem to take it out on whoever I am closest to, go through long depressive states where I can’t perform basic tasks, along with the other joys of being bipolar.

These are big parts of the reason my boyfriend left me and when we were arguing I would often remind him of sick I am and how it affects my actions. He would tell me that I use my disorder as an excuse and it became difficult for me to distinguish my illness from my actual personality,

I have had a depression for about 4 years. It feels bad for some reason to say that, like a feeling of shame.

I am 24 and I live with my parents. I have a few friends, with whom I dont really talk to about this stuff though.
My life isnt great right now. I feel like I am in a limbo between my fears (of the future, of rejection, of loneliness, of independence etc.) and my struggling dreams. 
These past 4 years of avoidance has just gone too fast, I feel like I am wasting my youth.
I have seen a therapist once a week for about a year. It has helped and got better.
But I still cant see how I am going to get out of this. It is like I am in a tunnel with only one way out and that way is blocked and impossible to get through. 
It is just too lonely even though my family know and I see a therapist. I am so f-ing sick of this numbing boringness. I feel socially understimulated out of my mind.

Well, best case scenario is that someone can relate. It feels good not to be alone with these thoughts.

I probably just need to talk to someone to ward this away, but my only friend who happens to be my fiance is currently away at work. Anyways, I have a history of depressive symptoms as well as some ""psychotic"" ones although I hate labeling them that way. I usually have to maintain certain things to feel like my life is worth living, and for the most part I have, but over the past few weeks I've become more and more despondent about almost nothing. I don't want professional help as I've already taken that route about 3 or 4 times (with the most recent involving a counselor and 2 psychiatrists). I'm just so unmotivated and I feel stagnant. I also feel as if I shouldn't say anything to anyone because it would make this problem worse, but I force myself to write this anyways. I'm also worried this may sound disorganized.

The main issue that makes me feel like this is that I love creating things, but I have a negative feedback loop. It could be anything from game design to just writing a block of text on a piece of paper, but I just become unmotivated shortly after beginning and throw it all down. Not only is that a result of whatever is bringing me down, but it subsequently makes me feel worse. I don't know what to do. I used to have things to look forward to and do. I used to be excited to wake up and complete the next task I had on my list, but now I don't really care if I got up out of bed at 9 am or 9 pm.

4341,"The Misunderstood Millennial It's as if, in our western culture, living to be ""perfect"" has become the norm. Where you want to take time to improve yourself, but have trailing thoughts of ""falling behind"" and the feeling of regret floods your system; the rest of your day is filled with anxious thoughts or the anticipation of stressors.

If you are not being perfect, you are behind, you are a loser. Got a bad grade on an exam? Look around you, everyone did well; why did you do so poorly? You're a failure. Why is this the 3rd time you've read that paper? Can you not understand simple English? How many more times do you have to read it? It's not that hard! Why are you not paying attention to the lecture? Stop getting distracted you pathetic loser; you have now spaced out for the first 15 minutes of lecture, not even worth listening to the rest of it, you're not gonna understand anything!
This is my best friend talking, ""Anxiety."" Nobody actually is verbally telling me this, and yet, it's what it feels like. 
A high self-monitoring, highly sensitive person, with anxiety that cries for no reason from time to time may know what I am talking about. I don't really know if those diagnoses are even correct. After searching on google for a couple of hours, those were the conclusions I arrived to. Whether true or not, I just spent hours browsing on the internet to diagnose myself with conditions that might be catalyzed simply of the usage of the internet, this bullshit artificial world. 

Anecdotally, our generation is fucked. I had an approach in writing out my post, but as I proceed, I only get angrier. Maybe the more I think about my life, why I am here? What am I doing? Is it important? I negatively get circulated in my own head.  
I am not suicidal, maybe not yet, I don't really know. I just don't really want to do anything anymore. I barely have time for myself, and when I do, I feel like I am falling behind in this competitive society we have created. And so the only thing I have left to do is work. 

Currently I am a student in Psychology, go figure. I have a job and work in a research lab that is geared toward research in stress, go figure again. My grades aren't even great. For the amount of time I spend doing homework/lab-work, the results are pretty shitty. I fear my professors and mentors look down on me, disappointed, whether true or not that only adds more anxiety. 

Anytime I open up to anyone, I am disregarded, not really taken seriously. I am very high in self-monitoring and so I never try to be negative or have unmotivated behavior around me peers. I have this disguise, happy, jolly, joke around (A LOT), and always try to keep everyone mentally engaged in discussions. And so with this behavior, it's easy to see someone disregarding my attempts in opening up or sharing personal information. I used to cry a lot, especially right after social interactions, strangely. I think it has to do with how lonely I get. I'd have a decent interaction with someone and maybe think to myself I am never going to have a nice genuine conversation like that again, and so I cry. Now I always get a feeling of wanting to cry. It's the feeling of your gut sinking and sinuses bulging slightly, but I am able to stop myself quickly.

It doesn't stop there. I don't make many attempts to make any friends. How is it, as a highly social creature, to not even attempt at making new friends. I think we are in a mental epidemic, and it's only getting worse and my escape to the field of Psychology is my way of finding out what the fuck is actually wrong with me. I feel so empty, so lost, I have depressive and manic times that sometimes last months. I read books to escape reality. I don't have goals, passions, vision. I am sure I have maybe some things going for me, but I can't think of any as I am in that circulatory way of thinking right now and I can't seem to get out.

1083,"Not bipolar. Asking for advice about my daughters mother who is bipolar. Hi. 
Need to clarify that I am using my wife's account to ask this question. I'm not a person who likes or enjoys social media (I'm an old fart) so please understand I'm only borrowing her account for this. Thank you. 

I hope someone can help me out with something I need to know. 

When my ex (daughters mom) is dealing with a common cold or flu she tends to go into almost a bipolar mania with borderline psychotic actions. She lashes out verbally and sadly physically. Last time a week ago she physically went after our 10 year old daughter. I had to drive to her house after my daughter called me terrified locked in the bathroom as her mother was kicking at the door. I have my daughter now, getting her therapy, and have a 3 year no contact order for my daughter and I against her mother. 

So when my ex gets sick with normal winter illnesses why does she spiral downward like this.? 

Then she blames anyone and everyone that it was there fault. My daughter was asked if she could go and get her mother a glass of water and my daughter said ok but could you please wait a few minutes so I can finish up my last bit of homework. Normally anyone would be ok thank you but not my ex. She started breaking things and basically telling our daughter that she doesn't care about mom and doesn't care about mom being sick and then into saying what did I ever do to you to make you hate me, just a glass of water and you couldn't even be responsible and respectful enough to go get it. 

Now my daughter is not a child that yells back or gets defiant (yet lol she's at least 2 years away from the hormones) and my daughter is very soft spoken and would help anyone who asked. Complete opposite of my ex thank the heavens. 

Plus my ex goes off and on meds for the last 14 years. She says she doesn't have a problem and if she did meds cure it and ya da all gone. 

Please help me understand the correlation between bipolar and colds/flus with a person who cycles back and forth and refuses meds then goes back on for roughly a month no more than that every few years. 

Thank you 


Update edit: 
For the record I don't plan on keeping the PFA order no contact for 3 years. That's what the judge ruled. I just wanted it for 3 months but with supervised visits for a few weeks leading into an actual custody order for my ex to have our daughter 50/50. But because ex was arrested (swinging at a cop and it was neighbors who called unbeknownst to me until the next day) the judge ruled this way. Yes I wanted to just get her out of my daughters life because I was extremely angry for a few years. It was for me. Not my daughter. It was so I could feel better. Thanks to my wife she's changed my view on how it shouldn't be a selfish want or desire. I had to think about my daughter AND my ex and how it wouldn't be a good thing for either of them if I stopped their relationship. So I apologize to everyone on here for being a jerk. My wife said I was being one lol ",bipolar,ID43297_bipolar,"

2903,"I hate driving, and I want to give up on life I'm 18, and I just got my learner's permit, so it's already obvious that I'm some sort of retard, since it took me so long just to get that. Today I started driving on the road for the first time, and I fucking hate it. I completely suck at it. Too much shit I have to pay attention to. I'm a fucking idiot, so I can't multitask to save my life. So you gotta stay in your lane and make sure the car doesn't drift, watch out for road signs and shit, and also be paying attention to traffic? Yeah, no. It's just not gonna happen, I'm too stupid.

Driving isn't the only thing I'm a failure at. School, work, money management. Basically any ""real world"" stuff that requires even the smallest bit of effort, I fuck it up. I suck at anything that has to do with the real world except socializing, and even with that I'm just average and plain at. Even the one real world skill that I enjoy, writing, I'm just plain at. Hell, even outside of the real world, I suck at everything. I suck at video games, and I always drop shows, even the ones I like. HELL, even the one thing I pride myself in, having a shit ton of useless knowledge, is fucked because there's just a ton of holes in the information I have stored.

Fuck, I just want to give up. Everything I do ends in failure. I was looking back on this time last year, compared to now. Everything was good, I had an amazing girlfriend, I had passed all my classes, I had a great job, and I had ""defeated"" the person I dislike most in life. Now? No girlfriend because I fucked up our relationship, no highschool diploma because I dropped out, I just left my second job, and the person I dislike the most in life now is me. What's even the point of this? I should just kill myself. I'm seriously tired of all this shit, it's all for nothing, seriously. People are always bitching at me for lounging around all day, and never trying to ""move forward"", but why would I? I'll just fuck it up in the end like an idiot anyways. It's never gonna improve. The only reason I'm still here is because a couple people need me to be strong for them, just a little while longer, but I can't even pretend to do that. I'm constantly breaking down (like this, actually) to them. I'd usually write all this shit and send it to a friend, but I'm tired of weighing them down with all this shit all the time. And don't even try to tell me that, ""It's you friends! That's what they're for!"" Bullshit. I can see the look on their faces. They don't want to loose me, but they're fucking tired of fighting. They've got their own problems too, they don't need to worry about whether or not I'm gonna jump of a bridge everyday too.

Fuck. Every time I look back on my life, I see nothing but failures. Being an extrovert is a bitch too, because I need to be around people to have any energy, but whenever I have energy, I act like a jackass, which makes me do, say, and act things that make me feel like a stupid jackass later on when I'm alone, which makes me want to go out less, which makes me have less energy, which makes my eventual social energy spikes even stronger, and the cycle goes on and on. Fuck it, people drained me instead, that would stop me from acting like an ass every time I'm being social. Of course, I never have enough self-awareness in the moment to control it. So I'm known  as this goofy dorky outgoing guy. It feels like a lie though, because whenever I'm alone, I'm depressed as hell. I also have anger issues, which make me feel like an even shittier person.

And of course, like this, I go on long ass ramblings and tangents that really serve no purpose but to clear my head, so I'm just spitting out information and thoughts in such huge volumes. No one has ever said it, but I'm sure it's fucking annoying. It's annoying to me whenever I realize I'm doing it.

Fuck it, what's the point of any of this? It's almost 2018, and everyone is saying, ""Don't bring anything negative with you into 2018."" What am I supposed to do then, kill myself within the next 4 hours? I absolutely am the only negative thing. I'm sure most people who know me would be shocked that I think any of this about myself. That's the power of being an extrovert, I'm just able to pull that positive energy out of my ass whenever I'm with people. It's ridiculous, and it makes me feel like a fake as fuck person, whether I'm being depressed or social. Almost everyone I know likes me, except me. And it's not like I plan to change for 2018 either. I don't have a plan, I don't have any goals. Once those 3 are out of highschool, I'm done, for real. I'll probably off myself before that honestly, because before then, I'll start college, and that'll give me a whole bunch of new opportunities to fuck up, which will really make me want to kill myself. Hell, maybe I'll join too many classes and clubs just to speed up the process quicker.

I don't care. Fuck me. Apathetic, incompetent, fake ass motherfucker.",suicide_watch,ID17757_suicide_watch,"

Now I realise how right he was. I remember thinking how life,god, the spaghetti monster or whatever brought me here for a reason. That my life would mean something. That i was ""destined"" to achieve great things. Now i have hit rock bottom and come to the conclusion that expecting something more if why im miserable. Maybe, just maybe there is not fairytale ending and maybe there's no scenario were I end up being successful and having a lovely person by my side. And hell i can live with that. I know im not special. But the reason I'm mad all the time and the reason i hate myself everyday is the look in my mothers eyes when she says I'm special. Hell she can be the devil sometimes but when she says it I actually though i was. 

My father was a fucking badass. She had nothing and accomplished a ton only with 17 euros and his balls. And it fucking breaks my hearts knowing that im just a shadow of a greater man. That i can't even dream to fill up his shoes. That my mother thinks that Im worth it. Im so sorry. I'm just not enough. God i wish i was but I'm not. 

I just wish i could reset my life and be the person my family needed me to be. I could live with myself knowing I'm a failure but I can't kife to the hope my family has put in me. I accept that there's nothing for me, that I'm not special. I just wish my family could see that and stop putting faith where there is none.

A few minutes ago, my mom called freaking out.  My niece was crying hysterically and saying my name.  That's all she could get out of her.

Apparently she had been watching videos on my mom's tablet and had found a video of her (my niece) singing happy birthday to me on one of my visits home.  By the time my mom pieced it all together, my niece was inconsolable, saying her heart hurt, and asking why I couldn't come sit with her in ""my chair"".

I did my best to calm her down, had her sing me a song, played a game on Skype, anything I could do.  When I was signing off, she said, ""Come home.  I'll be good, just come home.""

Yeah.  Feels bad man.  I'm a fucking wreck.",off_my_chest,ID37083_off_my_chest,"

It could be genetic, or perhaps I just saw too many scary movies as a little kid. Whatever the reason, the disease known as ""anxiety"" has crippled my entire life.

I barely graduated high school, turned down job promotions, had extreme difficulty with the opposite sex, avoided parties, and have recently been living under the dark cloud of extreme health anxiety because of this shit. I'm always on guard. If things go well for a day, the next will surely bring something worse.

Focusing on anything is a struggle. I work a shitty job, live at home still well into adulthood, and can't progress. Sometimes it doesn't feel worth living life like this.

Been to a psychiatrist. Cost $250 for a 15 minute diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Recommended seeing a psychologist, but I can't afford it. My GP gave me Xanax, which does help in the moment, but I don't want to be dependent on them. Considering SSRIs.

I already been to the doctors they prescribed me a medication but when I took it that following night (when it gets really bad) I thought I was dieing. I couldn’t of breathed so I called 911 and they said it was just a bad anxiety attack 2 Hours later the medicine was more or less out of me and I could sit down without feeling like dieing. 

Fast forward a week I am still having these episodes of a puking feeling, a lump in my throat, stomach ache and I can barely breath.

I have started the steps of going to my school counselor and trying to get help because I am more of a independent person I want to figure out this by myself I hate that you have to pay someone just to talk to them. It is about time I give in because honestly death is better than this pain I have been feeling. Honestly it feels like I have been spectating myself for the past 2 weeks I have not been in my body to relax. Mental illness is real

I guess to sum things up I need advice, advice on things to calm myself because I am not taking medicine after what happened I am too scared. Breathing techniques don’t help and I am talking to a counselor soon. My only option right now is to deal with it

2777,"My newest best friend is a better friend than any of my old ones. But he doesn't seem to think I am worth anything I went on exchange for half a year to Europe and met a new friend. So far he has helped me with so much shit that I consider him a best friend. He remembered my birthday despite having just met me and planned a party with a gift already in mind. He would drive me to the airport and text me the moment I got back to hang out. But when we hang with other people, I suddenly become background noise to him. We just become really good friends when we are chilling alone. He doesn't outright ignore me when we hang with other people, but suddenly that sense of friendship seems distant. Like he doesn't want to be associated with me.

My old friends grew up with me as children in the same neighbourhood. We always hung out together as kids and went to the same highschool. But they never planned a thing for me, I would always get them gifts and plan birthdays but never got anything back in return. When I left no one saw me off, and when I got back I had to almost beg them to hang out with me. 

Yet as a big group, my old friends don't treat me as background noise, together we all kinda get along fine and have fun as well. But unlike my new friend I never had that sense of closeness, of being able to share my problems and shit with them. Yet with the new guy he helped me through so much, from suicide to girl troubles. None of my old friends helped.

My old friends always talk about us as a group staying together forever because of our history. My memories of our past summers are what keeps me with them. 

I don't know what the hell I am to make of the situation. There was a time that I felt that my old friends were taking up a lot of my time and energy for essentially nothing in return and I wanted to cut them off. But I'm afraid that if I do that my new friend might not actually be as much of a best friend as he is right now. After the exchange we will be moving to the same country but no longer staying in the same apartment building.

1701,"Young adult still living at home with parents who don’t understand my anxiety I’m 23 and I still live at home. I am in a long distance relationship with a lovely guy who lives about 5 hours away by car. Both of my siblings are moved out which leaves me alone with my parents.. I recently got accepted into a graduate program that starts in the fall (yayy) but I have to hang around here and save up money until that starts. I’ve been struggling with GAD for a couple of years now which is normally made worse by communication issues in my LDR. Luckily, my boyfriend has been more sensitive to my anxiety and at least tries to understand what I’m going through. My parents, on the other hand, do not. 
I’ve been having a hard time living at home. My mom and I have been getting into dumb arguments about things like politics and religion and my dad gets mad at me when I upset my mom. It’s making our relationships suffer. This is anxiety-provoking because I used to be very close to both of my parents and now it seems as if everything is falling apart. Tonight, my mom expressed to me how she felt about our relationship and how she doesn’t understand why I don’t look up to them the way I used to and on and on and on.. I lost it completely. I ended up having a panic attack and cried uncontrollably. My mom just stared at me with a disappointed look on her face and my dad (who has never said anything mean to me in his entire life) came out and screamed at me, cornered me into my room, called me a stupid idiot, and slammed my door. 
Part of me understands why they reacted this way. I’ve been having panic attacks over seemingly silly things for a while and know they are fed up with me. I can’t help but feel disappointed and remorseful for letting it happen again. I already feel horrible about myself every time it happens. This was just a bit of a vent..

But even if nobody responds, I feel I may as well get this out. I hate myself. Other people hate me, and I may as well rid them of my burden. But I tried hanging, and I fucked that up. Wouldn't want anything messy to help others avoid cleanup duty, couldn't jump in front of a train or car so that I don't traumatise the driver.

So I may as well waste away. Maybe once it starts hurting I'll know if I'm really here or just stuck in some sick escapist fantasy, actually in the past.

If I am, I wake up. If I'm not, I get some rest. That'd be nice.

I don't want to die. I suppose that's the distinction. I want some rest. My life, every event, every conversation, I've seen it all before, it just feels like the past keeps turning back up. No matter how much progress I make, it just feels like a loop. I go into severe paranoid episodes that I'm stuck in timeloops, and this isn't helping. I feel this is a way to break the cycle.

I wake up to go to sleep. That's it. So figure I may as well take that to its logical extreme and live to die.

 Death is sort of the great sleep, isn't it?

Either I break free from the loops, or I break free from life altogether. Truth be told, either option is more appealing than the present.

If I fade away, maybe I'll eventually have some saccharine epiphany, and finally ""be alive"". Don't care. Anything but this.

I trade my what-ifs for others like 

What if my illness were more than just wonders

I’m sick of being sick of me

Grit my teeth, weaken the knees

I can only run for so long before I trip and see

That I can’t change my outcome

My mind constantly races, I wish I could live without one

I’m my own worst enemy, and that’s reality

I take the smallest thing and turn it into tragedy

I sip a coffee to wake up,

But caffeine rattles my brain like I’m insane

But… I guess that’s just my makeup

I used to live carefree, but now I’m so scared, please

Just leave me the fuck alone

Not anybody in general, but my own body, the temple

My insides like catacombs

Find my way to the dark

And be back at home

The place I was taken from without consent

Only to be returned, broken and bent

I can’t even be comfortable when I’m at ease

I create a storm from a gentle breeze

Why am I like this, where did it come from

It’s like most of me is in a big number

I fight to feel the rays but I’m trapped in the overcast

I pray for clarity, but I haven’t prayed in ages

If I end up in hell, then it’s probably better than what I face

On a daily basis

I can’t even escape it on vacations

I try to relax but only relapse

Into another attack

Nothing’s intact

I can’t hold it together

I’m slowly sinking on this endeavor",anxiety,ID43248_anxiety,"

1045,"Frustrated with insurance and trying to increase Latuda while on volitile ground. I'm probably not going to mention anything here that anyone hasn't heard or experienced before. I'm actually in a fairly calm state right now. Though I'm concerned that will change and it probably wont take all that long. I'm depressed and I'm waiting on something to happen that will be send me over.  And everything is primed as it always is to go over. 

I've been on latuda 60mg for about a month now. I was starting to not like the effects as I was starting to feel like a shell of a person. However now I am wanting that stability bc I'm afraid of whats coming. Home is in a very volitile situation right now. We are both BP where I am suspected 2 and she is confirmed 1. Because our relationship is deteriorating or in its death throws last night was an ugly night as she came at me. I locked myself in my room. I did this bc I didn't want to get hurt nor did I want to be provoked into retaliating. I know its wrong. I chose to hide while my door got destroyed. That passed as I recognized the rage she was experiencing for my own when I have been in that state. 

However I am now out of my Latuda. I only have my vyvanse and pot. I think the pot mellowed me out so much to where I wouldn't allow myself to be pulled into the fire. That however does not always work. I am not good when it comes to doing all the leg work and calling as I am having to do now. I'm dealing with the manufacture discount card and it not working bc of how my insurance wants to classify this med. They want $280 for a month of this stuff. I cant afford that. I can but I wont. Because of this kind of bullshit the likelihood that I will give up on treatment increases. Its a shame that this kind of crap occurs in the behavioral heath arena. Yeah no news to anyone here, I'm sure. 

I called the doc to request some samples. I also requested that we try increasing my dose. They agreed so I'll be going from 60mg to 80mg. The 60mg made me somewhat zombie like. Or in a daze, but I could work. However I still had outbursts but not as often. I want them gone so I'm asking for more. That and also to see what my limit is on this drug. 

TL;DR  My BP1 SO and I are in a volitile state in our relationship. I'm out of latuda and having to deal with insurance bullshit in order to get more all while increasing my dosage. I'm fairly calm now, but I'm scared that it wont last. ",bipolar,ID38226_bipolar,"

3266,"I feel like I shouldn't be allowed to exist because of how disgusting I am Really stupid rant/vent incoming

I truly believe I am the most horrendous creature on this earth. I wouldn't even call myself human because I'm so monstrous I feel I don't resemble one. It should be considered a crime for me to expose my appearance to other people. No one deserves to look at such a disgusting thing. I don't deserve to be alive.

Those thoughts are always in the back of my head. Sometimes I'll look at myself and feel confused because I don't understand how I could feel like that. I look normal. Even pretty sometimes. And other times I'll look at myself and cry and scream and vomit because of how hideous I am. I don't understand why I have to hate myself so much. 

How can my feelings change so much? How can I be okay with who I am one moment and want to die because of how I look the next? I can't even trust my eyes to know how I look. I don't know if I'm pretty and I don't know if I'm hideous. And I can't ask anyone because I know every answer other than ""you're disgusting"" will make me think they're lying to make me feel better.

When I see someone look at me, I know they're thinking of me. Thinking how can a human look this grotesque. Despising me. Hating me because my existence forced them to look at me. I don't ever want to go outside because I know I'm being looked at and being watched and being hated.

I'm so tired. I've been in therapy since I was 6 because of things like this. 13 years of therapy hasn't helped one bit. In fact, I hate myself even more. Because wouldn't constant lessons change my mind a bit if I was actually wrong? So I must be right. I haven't been to a doctor since October but I have made an appointment for next month. I don't know if I can last that long. 

I've covered up all the mirrors and windows in my house and I've covered the cameras on my phone and computer. There are 3 people I can stand looking at me. I have to leave the house next Sunday and the Sunday after that. How can I do that when I'll be subjecting everyone around me to look at a monster?

( they weren't even really friends cuz I didn't have there social media or anything we just like talked because we had no one else to talk to and all) and people are already spreading false rumours about me. so school isn't really that great. My teachers hate me (Atleast 3/4 of them) and my mom just made everything worse putting a note in my AGENDA (highschool and you still use your agenda??) saying please sign his agenda everyday and make sure he puts his work and stuff on it. So I get bullied for that too (looks, grades too and for using my agenda like  a pre-schooler) So that's my life at school and already feel suicidal about them then my mom makes it like 40 times worse but I don't want it to get too long but she puts me to the edge of suicide like saying I'm a nuisance not needed a waste of space and money and all. And so when I go to sleep I'm always super depressed and suicidal so I just think of ways of suiciding like a noose or like shooting myself when my mom gets home from work (sadly I don't have a rope or a gun though) and I think of a death note like. Finally that nuisance is out of your life or, looks like a different jackass  died (because my bro has cancer and she calls everyone a jackass) and like I finally did something you wanted for once!

I study like an A+ student, yet I get A- or Bs. We had a momentum test today in physics and the very first thing I do is draw the vector diagram wrong. If you don't know what I'm talking about, that is essentially the step 1 of problem solving and the most basic part of the problem. Last physics test, I got confused because I became unsure about something and it contradicted what teacher taught us. Two of these tests were really really easy and the whole class got it right except me. When I ask the teacher about it for advice he gives me a dirty look like I'm just a lazy fuck trying to squeeze out extra grades from him.

All of these fuckin asians get perfect scores without even thinking. I pay attention, I take notes, I know everything and can do every question you throw at me, yet tests always seem to double fuck me in the ass. The highest mark I have ever gotten in a science class is 92%. I don't get nervous during tests and I double check answers multiple times. I feel like all of this studying I do is useless and I'll never get anything higher than +90%. The funny thing is, such thing rarely happens in math. Probably because math is purely quantitative unlike other sciences.

Every time we have a test it destroys my self esteem so bad. I feel like no universities are going to accept me like this. I am slowly losing my motivation to even attempt any of the questions from newer units. Fuck. Me. ",off_my_chest,ID10782_off_my_chest,"

3701,"A Breakup, Anti Depressants, &amp; the worst 3 months of my life. I’m writing this is an absolute last resort. I never thought I would be spilling my soul to internet strangers but I’m at the point where I’ve exhausted all of my options except the permanent one.

Over the Spring/Summer of 2017, I met a girl who I waited 32 years to meet. I truly was in love with her almost instantly. I felt more for her in 2 months than I’ve ever felt for anyone in my entire life, and I’ve had multiple LTR’s. The problem is, I didn’t realize any of this until after I left her. She was absolutely perfect for me in every way, I was just completely oblivious to it and decided that we should end it as we were coworkers.

Here’s where it gets weird..

For 2 months after the split I was completely happy. I never even grieved for a second and thought that I had simply lost all feelings towards her. We even worked directly right next to each other and I was able to see her everyday without feeling anything at all. Until I went on vacation at the end of October. I was preparing to board my flight in Florida on 10/29 and BAM! All these realizations and feelings crept up. I had truly made the biggest mistake of my life and needed her back. I came back to work several days later and told her everything. I couldn’t explain why I had lost all feelings initially (and still can’t), but I poured my heart out to her and asked for her back. It was then that she told me she had a new boyfriend and she wasn’t interested in reconciling.

At that moment, my world shattered. I ended up quitting my job several days later as seeing her each day was making me increasingly depressed. Since December, I have been without a job and the reality that the girl that I love more than anyone I’ve ever known is with someone else. I began to feel suicidal after several weeks of being unemployed / heartbroken beyond belief. I had become reclusive, and only left my bed to eat and shower. My depression snowballed until one day in January where I took a handful of pills and tried to take my own life. I had been on Effexor XR since the day she destroyed me, and at this point was increasing my dosage without the doctors permission as I was desperate.

The suicide attempt was 3 weeks ago. I spent a few days in an inpatient program and was put on a taper schedule from Effexor as the head Psychologist had determined that the Effexor wasn’t working or making the depression worse. As I tapered off 225mg daily of Effexor, I started on 60mg daily of Cymbalta. It was a steep taper schedule, and I stopped taking the Effexor within 10-14 days. I was still completely destroyed by her, but I wasn’t suicidal anymore and even had a few days where I felt like I was going to be okay. The sadness was manageable.

Until a week ago..

She reached out to me out of nowhere after not speaking or seeing each other since the day I quit my job to tell me she’ll love me forever and basically everything I had been waiting to hear for months..Except for the part where she mentioned that she was still with her new boyfriend and loved him. Since that day, the massive cloud of sadness has returned and nothing is working to take it away. I just sat in the shower and cried for over an hour. Even as I write this it feels like there is a 500 pound weight on my chest. I have began researching suicide methods again and have 0 desire to job search or do much of anything.

I’m not entirely sure what I’m looking to accomplish with this post, but I’m praying that someone out there might have some input. I’m starting to think that this level of sadness is NOT normal to feel after the demise of a 2 month relationship regardless of how much I loved her. I hope it’s the medication making things worse or simply not working at all, as in that case I will talk to my doctor and Psychiatrist about being put on something else or increasing the dosage. In my head, I feel like perhaps I’m only feeling this low once again as she reached out and broke my heart again. But is it enough to make me feel suicidal? I’m not sure, and perhaps I’m dealing with extreme clinical depression on top of this horrible breakup grief. The sadness and pain 100% feels like it’s directly related to losing her, but perhaps my mind could be playing tricks on me. It’s been 3 months since she told me, and I feel even worse or the same than I did initially.

2516,"I can't kill myself because of my cat. I realized that today. This little furball shows me a very specific kind of affection. She even learned how to give ""human"" hugs. Everyday, sometimes a few times a day, she hops on my knees, takes her paws and face on my shoulders and purrs loudly, knitting my shirts and sweaters with her claws. I never saw her do that to anyone or anything. Just me. 

Not always, but most of the times, when I'm stressed or I feel low, she storms into my room and just does kitty things. Sometimes she interacts with me, sometimes she allows to pet her without doing anything back, sometimes she's just there, having an eye on me. Also, she always sleeps in my chair, next to the bed. Almost everynight. 

Today, I felt suicidal since the morning and I was even making plans, but another session of a kitty imitating human hugs made me research the topic of cat feelings. It turns out, that those little creatures can get depressed when their owner is not around and overall it stresses them out, gives them anxiety, makes them apathetic and waiting for the owner to come back.

4394,"Looking for the courage to end it. I've been battling depression since early childhood. Started with the shrinks in preschool. Managed to keep it at Bay for a good while. Only those close to me could see it. At some point in my early to mid 20s, it kicked me in the ass again. I sat on my bed with a knife to my neck and realized it wasn't sharp enough.

I battled dark thoughts into my thirties, but, I was able to keep the worst of them at Bay. Last fall, I finally went to my doctor for help. The meds did nothing but make me sleep. I didn't give a shit about anything when I was awake because I was mentally numb.

I'm tired of looking for reasons not to end it. The goal in life shouldn't be to live for as long as possible. It should be to make the best of what you have, regardless of length. Quality, not quantity. I can't see the quality in mine.

Objectively, it's not a bad life. I have a roof over my head, food in my belly, and a dog by my side. It's a chemical thing for me. It's not situational. My brain is broken and I'm tired of denying it.

I've started looking at firearm prices the other night. I find it amusing that they seemed to be too expensive for a one time use device when I wouldn't have to pay any more bills once I'm gone. Maybe that means I'm not 100% there yet. Maybe it means I need to choose another method. I had a friend who just walked into the ocean one day.

2292,"Hello. Uh, I just needed to share this. Backstory real quick of myself; 21, F, junior majoring in computer science. I have anxiety, depression, and ADHD. Anxiety was very high in my first two years, but recently was diagnosed with depression and my suicidal thoughts have gone up as well. Okay to the thing &gt;

In my American literature class, we were told to write a sentence or two down that would be portrayed in a gothic text, and I wrote, “as death came closer, with his haunting figure, his dark ripped clothing, and his newly polished scythe, I felt a moment of peace before my existence shattered in my mirror of life. The last shard, only holding the essence of which my being is, is now forever lost.”

As I wrote this, I somehow felt like this spoke to me and how my depression makes me feel and what I perceive. Shortly after this, I made an appointment with my counselor. I took my disorder into my own hands to overcome it, by seeking help. Sometimes most people who have these thoughts don’t really reach out for help and that’s a stigma that I’m trying to overcome. Always remember that there is someone out there that you can talk to and get at least a little to a lot of help. You’re not alone because I’m going through it too. ~Taz",depression,ID11395_depression,"

I have No family or friends other than my wife but my marriage has fallen apart suddenly. I either stay in the home and be a pariah or I'm homeless. My little three person family is the only reason I have to live. My dad and mom were drug addicts my mom deserted me and my dad was in and out of jail my whole life til he died long ago. My grandmother raised me but she died too. I feel like everyone has deserted me. I don't even have the choice of killing myself because I can't stand the thought of my son maybe needing me one day.

2404,"this dream I had for many years, I understand it now For years I kept having dreams of being chased by someone or something. It would never get me though, because I would be too fast, but it would keep chasing me. I would fight back and I would always win, but I would end up exhausted when I wake up.

I guess that dream is just a symbolic representation of how I feel about life. Always stressed, always anxious, always like being chased, but nothing bad really happens.

Honestly, I don't know how much worse this can get. Willl this damn body eventually be out of cortisol?

Maybe that's the reason I feel like I want to die all the time. I just want to sleep, to relax, no thoughts, no fears, no worries, no chasing anymore. I don't even know if this is depression or anxiety, or both. Maybe it's not just the desperation, lack of joy and hopelessness, but also the fact that life outright terrifies me that contribute to it.",anxiety,ID34536_anxiety,"

I never thought I would turn into this person. And yet, outside of college, I'm fine. I genuinely regret going to college. I wish I had taken a year off before college and tried things. I wish I had tried a job like this before college. On the other hand, I read about automation and how low skilled jobs are going to be lost. So, maybe I should suck it up and get that stupid degree to give myself a bit of an edge. I always start the term thinking that things would be hard. That assignments would be hard. That I would struggle. Then, the end of the term comes and I regret making things harder than they needed to be.

So I'm scared. I'm scared to even open up to him about how bad it really is. I'm scared of judgement. Of him trying to press charges on my mom (because she doesn't try to help me) to get the child custody on my sister(parents are divorced, I am not considered a child anymore). Of him pressing me into healing naturally. Of him being not understanding.

ALSO - he has actually told me the ""people have it worse, some are disabled, some are blind, be happy about what you have"" bs

•My mom is openly calling me lazy, spineless and weak-willed. She doesn't believe in mental illnesses. She legitimately thinks that I'm faking it and I'm just lazy. Basically, she doesn't care about me. When I'm sick, most she'll do - open a window. That's all.

•I have no one to talk about this and feel understood afterwards.

•Have been to psychotherapist twice and I know that I had to go through a course(?) and it doesn't help immediately... but I still absolutelt hated it.

•My immune system is basically non-existent at this moment. I catch every virus I can, I get pinched nerves in my back every month or so. And that leads us to =&gt;

•Because of being ill a lot, I miss out on a lot of things in school(last year rn). So I have a lot of things to do, many deadlines are coming up... But I have 0 motivation. I am fully aware of the consequences(dropping out), but I still have no energy fot that. And then it piles up and I'm stressed about not doing anything and it piles up again and so on. Never ending cycle!

•Because of finishing HS this year, I have to find an university etc. There's a long story about my search, but, long story short - I failed, my parents aren't doing any help but just reminding me and it stresses me out.

IN CONCLUSION

I am stressing out about my stress. Too scared to seek help, scared of my mother saying ""stop acting as an idiot and just go and do (..) without thinking"" and not understanding me. Scared of my dad trying to tell me that ""you don't have it that bad."" Scared of being seen as weak and an attention seeker. Scared of being misunderstood. Scared of opening up. I cry myself to sleep, feeling things I cannot described. Being dragged, ripped up in two pieces by two different forces... idk. Feeling empty. Helpless. As a burden.

Thanks for reading if you got this far... I feel a bit easier.

1969,"Nothing to Offer Hi, I've been lurking in suicidewatch on and off for quite some time now, desperate to find some sort of post that accurately relates to mine (so that I might selfishly soothe my own guilt and pain). And while I have found some that vaguely resemble my own experiences, and read some useful advice given by people with far purer hearts than my own, nothing I have seen can truly tap into the sense of worthlessness that surrounds me. So here I am, desperate for anyone to humour me with even the slightest shred of undeserved empathy. 

First the basics: I am a weak and frail 19 y/o man (if that's what you can call me) with a disgusting physical appearance (long nose, recessive chin, uneven eyeline, crooked teeth, hideous smile, hunched posture), Autistic Spectrum Disorder (I have terrible social skills and have only acquired friends through putting up a front - friends who I would support in their decision to abandon me should they ever stumble upon this), rigid and isolationist behaviors (I retreat to my room in almost all of my free time), no talent (I have taken two separate courses and achieved nothing), and a history of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (with intrusive thoughts that poke and prod at me every day of my existence). At first glance, this list may perhaps seem like standard fare for the sorts of things someone would levy at themselves on here, but these are simply obstructions that prevent me from rising higher in society, with the reason I am completely incompatible with it being a far more sinister corruption of the human form. 

I was never a good person. As a child, I was stubborn, angry, and a bully - to the point in which I constantly wonder why I have any friends at the current moment, and whether I deserve them when there are those walking this earth today most likely in perpetual hurt as a result of the things I have said to them. I'm thankful that I'm not a bully anymore, but perhaps being one would be far preferable to what I am now, and what I am now is a vile pervert. I discovered pornography at the age of 11, and quickly became fascinated by at, most likely due to my hyper-obsessive nature, and while I started out being like any other hormone-driven teen, I soon found myself headed down a road of complete deviancy. My worst moments came about in the three or four years during and surrounding my eating disorder (12-16), in which I touched myself to the likes of bestiality (both simulated and real - though only real a couple of times during my younger years), scat, strange fetishes such as stuffing, pregnancy and other vile things, and a video of a real rape posted to liveleak (or at least I think I did; there have been so many things I have watched that a lot of it has faded from memory entirely). When I was thirteen, I also went as low as to search for (but luckily not find and within days decide to stop searching for) CP (i could try to justify this by saying I never actually looked at it, or that I was only searching for people of my age, but the reality is that I don't know the situation and nothing can truly justify such an intention). I also obsessed over many people in a sexual fashion (schoolmates, teachers, friends' moms), fantasizing over them sexually and masturbating to their social media profiles like the sick freak I was. There were also instances in which I masturbated to cartoon characters who were clearly underage, and that makes my incredibly uncomfortable with myself as a person. Though I got 'better' as I matured, I still frequently touched myself to questionable material, and often frequented sites such as Shadbase, and the Rule34 site to get my twisted kicks, only stopping a couple of months ago when I could no longer justify it to myself. I have been entirely porn-free for over a month now, and while I more morally-pure for it, I cannot shake the crippling guilt of what I've done (how could I ever hope to have a real relationship, a marriage, or kids knowing with what I've done forever looming over me?), nor can I get rid of the sick thoughts that still haunt me. I have still been masturbating to deal with the stress, and every time I do, I feel the perversion creeping back. My thoughts are so twisted that random sick thoughts enter my mind - thoughts of things that I rationally hate, yet feel no disgust towards and I have to force them out with self-loathing and rage. There are days of hope, sure, but they are being sucked away by the days of corruption, in which I can no longer bear to live. I do not want this corruption spreading to my friends and family, and thus I am too afraid to tell them, but they know something is wrong and cannot understand why I would be so harsh on myself. When I see a child, I avert my eyes, paranoid that some sort of explicit thought will enter my mind (which it sometimes has). My thoughts are so muddled that I can no longer discern what truly arouses me and what is paranoia - making me unstable and dangerous to those around me. I do not deserve life. 

I have had the pills in front of me, I have pressed the knife to my wrist, and I have written the note to leave behind, yet I am too cowardly to do what is best for the greater good. I am too vain to want to imagine my lifeless corpse scarred and bloated, and too attached to those who love me to want to see them hurting over losing me (or what they know as me). 

I could talk more about the father that despite my love for, I harbor a deep-seeded resentment towards for his inability to connect with me on a deeper emotional level, his seemingly apathetic attitude towards my younger self, and his never-forgotten bouts of anger (in which he would scream at me, hit me and threaten to hit me whenever I got on his bad side), but it would just feel like an exercise in excuse-making. I could talk about how a spent a year of my school life, spending every break standing in the cold alone, talking to myself as my only company, but it would feel like another exercise in excuse-making. I cannot justify the awful person that I am, and therefor cannot justify my existence.   

I don't blame only myself, though. There are times in which I am filled with an intense bitterness at the quick-to-judge masses that are so quick to dismiss people like me before hearing their story. I hate the fact that I am doomed to be hated. I feel like even people as wonderful as you on this forum are only willing to help me because you feel obligated by your sense of morality to do so, rather than any desire to see a person like me find any happiness.
Everyone is here to judge, and no one to help. Nobody really cares about me - the real me, and it would only pain them if they even glimpsed my true self. I am a detriment to society and do not deserve to live either way, so perhaps suicide will be my way of expressing this... if I can muster up the courage.

In spite of everything I've said here, I have such a love for so many things in life: music, my friends and family, art and movies, and yet this love will be overshadowed by the fact that, despite my attempts to improve, I will always be unworthy of any love back. I'm sorry if this was poorly written or hard to read, or too graphic and hard to stomach, but I'm just so tired and scared. I don't know what to do anymore, and I know no one really wants to help me... perhaps I'm just desperate. 

Extra Details: 
- I have started seeing a therapist for these issues, yet they haven't contacted me back for another appointment - leading me to trust them less. (I spent a long time in therapy for my eating disorder and was mainly antagonized rather than treated.)
- I have been on antidepressants since the age of around 13 and have recently switched to a new one - with varying degrees of success. 
- In spite of all the demented things I have watched, the great majority of my porn-watching was regular pornography (not trying to detract from what I did - I'm just putting it out there).
- I have other deviant sexual desires that I am less ashamed of (eg. a lust for crossdressers, and bigger women) though these things torment me less than the others.

4651,"Admitting I Have a Problem Hello, I've been lurking this Reddit for the last week and a half. I like that you all have such a supportive and active community!

I'm kind of at my nadir right now with that's been going on. I don't have health insurance despite having a solid career, but will be enrolling during open enrollment next month. I want to get an official diagnosis (and I see you guys are very against self-diagnosis) for what's been going on for the last 2 years. Kind of out of nowhere I started having depressive episodes that last entire months followed by a month and a halfish periods of extreme productivity and zeal. When I'm up I workout 7 times a week, love my job and training, and create amazing music and poetry without even trying. When I'm low I just sleep. I literally slept like all of winter away last year. 

I'm at a point where I'm fed up. I just got over a 20 day depressive episode (I use Moodtrack!) and had a lot of thoughts I almost acted on. I have trouble getting to work on time because I'm so exhausted and was late 3x last week which got me in huge trouble. (I'm working 9-5 since I broke my arm and now I don't have the luxury of a unique schedule that let me sleep entire days). Being like this is ruining my life since my job is a big part of my life and happiness. I'm on the bubble and that's creating new stress. I'm in the fire service and while we as a whole like to pretend we care about behavioral health, it's only ever stuff like PTSD from calls that gets attention and care and everyone else is looked down on. Furthermore a lot of the public safety resources are shit. Run by well meaning women and men in the service but they  don't know what to say or do and can only send you through endless referrals that don't go anywhere. The nature of my job is stressful and I've been in denial admitting something is wrong because it might mean I'm not capable for this career. This scares me. 

I've been working on more accountability and staying disciplined I saw a nice thread by hypohallucination about being off medication and it's been helping out a lot. I don't like the idea of being on medication. 

Anyway, thanks for listening.

2392,"Do psychiatrists/psychologists really not talk to each other because of privacy laws? I had an old psychologist that I went AWOL with when he said he thought I had bipolar and I disagreed.  It's been a year and I gave in and saw a psychiatrist to see what's wrong with me.  He asked if I had seen anyone previously and I described the psychologists location/traits and my psychiatrist identified him by name.  How likely do you think he will contact my old psychologist about my case to get info?  

I really wanted to go in with a fresh start and no previous bias so I really don't want them to talk.  I'm pretty sure they're not allowed to, but have y'all ever hear of doctors that talk amongst each other about patients?

I'm more worried because the first psychologist would give me details about other patients (obviously no names), but I'm scared commingling is a norm in this location because I remember him saying something about talking to other doctors too.

3573,"r/relationships removed this -- so i'm posting it here. advice/opinions welcome I am 19 and male-ish, she is 19 and female-ish.

We have been dating for a year and a half roughly, and from the beginning this has been a relationship that was incredibly intense for both of us.

Some context -- she is a victim of childhood sexual abuse and forced prostitution, and a IV heroin/opiate user and addict for the past 6 years of her life. I was unaware of the drug/sexual abuse when we started dating but have since become an integral part of her recovery and her family. I saved her life when she overdosed on my couch back in June, and have been around her countless times when she was using in order to make sure she is safe. 

I have worked closely with her family to try to stop her usage of heroin and other harmful abusive substances i.e. meth, cocaine. We have been largely successful -- during the bad times of our relationship she was using heroin multiple times per day and stealing when she ran out -- now she is down to once a month or less, and is in addiction therapy five days a week.

She is also, by consequence of being a child prostitute and drug addict, a serial liar, and has lied to me about things such as when she is using, whether she is cheating on me or not, whether she was having safe sex when we were experimenting with polyamory, and more. This has led to me being unable to trust her with almost anything, and doubting whatever she says. She has since, as far as I can tell, cut down on the compulsive lying, and I believe she is sincerely working on getting better. Again, though, I cannot tell when she is being truthful or not. 
 
The problem is that I think that I have some kind of blockage from being around her in so many different terrifying situations, and from taking care of her at my own expense (I almost failed my first semester of college because I was calling hospitals, her family, and her constantly: this was during a period when she was psychotic and actively suicidal/homicidal). My sexual desire towards her has diminished immensely, where it is actually now hard to convince myself that I want to have sex with her. I am scared of telling her this because I fear she may hurt herself or otherwise freak out and buy more heroin to cope. This aversion to sex also comes about, I think, because she is hypersexual when she is high, and I have come to associate any desire to have sex with that fake ""everything-is-great-but-I-don't-know-what's-going-on"" heroin high. 

Witnessing her overdose, which at the time I thought had not affected me too much, has become a staple in my dreams almost every night, and I wake up crying or shaking pretty frequently. Though I fear for her less than I used to, I still am constantly worrying and suspicious of her. I can tell nearly 100% of the time when she is high around me, and me being upset when she is makes her even more upset and manipulative.

I do not feel like I have any real life -- she gets upset when I do not contact her or do not pay enough attention to her. She does not seem to inquire much about me or my life, and consistently forgets things that I tell her about what is happening in my life.

 She also, most likely as a result of abuse, has a very childish view of most things, and is very ""all or nothing"" about anything in our relationship. This, along with her manipulative behavior, have forced me in the past to not discuss things that are troubling me.

Finally, I am slightly worried that there is a potential for her to hurt me if I try to break up with her -- she's threatened to stab me in the past and brandished a knife at me when I tried to throw away her drugs in the past.

I know that this seems to be a no-brainer: oh obviously you should break up with her, this is textbook abusive. But I fear that she will lapse back into daily use if I do, or attempt suicide. I do care for her -- and believe in her potential for recovery, and don't want to ruin all the progress we have made. She has already attempted suicide 8 times, and only from my intervention the past 3 times has she failed. 

I do not have the time nor the space here to describe everything that has happened in this past year and a half, but it is more than I could say. 

This is a complicated situation, and I do not know what to do. I just know that it can't last from my end that much longer -- I feel more lost and depressed than before, unsupported, and in the position of being the sole reason that this person I care for is not dead yet. I have tried my absolute hardest to be a good and caring partner, and give her the support she needs, while also being made to feel like I am not ever doing enough and that I cannot live up to the expectations. 

Sorry for the essay.

tl;dr. dating a drug user who I have saved the life of many many times, don't feel like I can do this much longer. I have lots of patience, but it is not infinite. We are probably enabling each other.",off_my_chest,ID38111_off_my_chest,"

4480,"I guess im here because Im depressed. Hear me out, anyone out there. You dont have to be nice to me if you don't want to. I choose to begin at a very weird point in my story so bear with me.
5 years ago I began dating this girl from my school, we we're both 17. We had some good times.
In about a year's worth of time her parents told me that she had PTSD and mild schizophrenia which had gotten worse, the lying and impersonation of other people she would do was a clear sign of poor mental health. She went to another city with her parents where their doctors could help her out. This for some reason took a major toll on me. I had gradually begun to fall prey to not being able to trust people.
I graduated from Junior college (High school for people not from India) and began studying for my bachelor's degree. I made some friends in my first year, on the first day infact. Im still friends with them, at least for now.
In my second year, after a lot of getting used to new people, i started dating this other girl I new since my childhood. 
We had some good times and some great times,which I won't talk about here. I was 20 and overweight (I'll get to this later).
Never had I been loved so much by someone so  charming. So it began to feel like I belonged in this world.
We dated for a year again. 
She had to transfer to Dubai, because her dad worked on a rig. 
So her education would be handled there. 
We thought we could make long distance work. 
Three months into her moving there, I heard of her passing. 
I was distraught. 
I don't usually consume alcohol. But I remember getting piss drunk and crying about it. 
It felt like the one thing I lived for was taken away from me.
Remember I said I was overweight, needless to say I'm insecure too. This has never left me. I try working out, curb my diet. Everything, but to no avail.
Skip ahead to last year, 2017, I've begun to feel like my Friends don't want me in their group anymore.
One of them suggested I do Intermittent Fasting, a dietary regimen with a consistent workout, and it helped. 
But in the mean time it felt like they wanted me to do it so it won't be embarrassing for them to be seen with me. Now I've got an okay face, and as of now I've lost a fair bit of the weight (10 kilograms in 12 weeks, which for me is great progress). 
You're probably saying "" why is he still depressed?""
I'm ostracized by the same people who help me. 
The people with whom I used to chill and go places with Everytime, the people who would voluntarily invite me now keep secrets from me, pretend like I don't exist and avoid me as much as possible. 
This gives me anxiety and a insecurities.
I'm not happy. 
I've never been treated like a friend by most people. 
Everyone has someone to do things within my group. Whether it's among themselves or with their girlfriends or boyfriends. I always used to be involved but now I believe they've outgrown me. 
This is probably why I have trust issues. 
People say, be who you are.
But I can't. 
I've almost had enough of this. 
My music, videogames and Netflix is literally what's keeping me alive right now.

I don't want friends if it has to be this way and yes I guess I'm complaining a little. But how much can one person endure before they hit their breaking point? 

Sorry to take up your time reader. 
I'm immune to the ""go kill yourself"" comments so bring them on if you have to. But anything helpful will do too.

And thanks, if you read till the end.",depression,ID28837_depression,"

It had to do with a criminal dieing and he believes he's gone to heaven since he gets whatever he wants. However, he finds that he is actually in hell after he discovered that getting everything only made everything pointless and dull. Everything I have thought would improve my life and happiness has come true. I always wanted someone to love me, ended up married for several years before getting divorced. Wished I could get a new job and got it now iv been there for 5 years and couldn't be more depressed. Met the most amazing girl at that job that even when I unintentally pushed her away she was always there for me. And when she got a promotion I sank into a deeper depression since I didn't get to see her as often. I began to ignore her since I didn't want to bother her with my problems and she ended up married and recently had a child. I saw her today and thats what breaks my heart, she's still here for me after everything I put her through but I lost the only person who I could connect with and just be happy. I know this is a small list but my life is full of examples. If you made it through that thank you for your time. I hope all of you can eventually live happy lives.

410,"My soon to be suicide note. If your reading this then it means I'm dead. I've lived a hard life. Ever since I found out who I was, I've been in a constant state of depression. This is who I am, I'm an 18 year old boy named John doe, a name I hate it, because it reminds me of my father and what I'm afraid I'll become. I also have severe trust issues, which means I can't have any sort of relationship with anyone because I'm afraid there gonna leave me. I felt I derived this feeling from the abandonment of my mother and my father constantly going in and out of jail, even after him saying he'll change and he won't leave again. Ever since these events happened, I've lost the feeling of a family love, I honestly don't remember what love feels like or to be loved. How does one want to be a father and not be there for his son. He abandon me for 2 weeks while he hid from the cops, I was about 14 i think at the time. A father abandons his son for 2 weeks to hid, like what the fuck is with that. I could also constantly hear him and his gf fight and hear him beat the shit out her over and over again. While I hid in my room scared. One of my earliest memory of my father was him waking me up in the middle of the night, because for what I assume, he got into a fight with his mother and wanted to leave so he took his toddler son half way across town in the middle of the night to his GF. Now about my mother who abandon me when I was 5. There's not much to say actually, only she has 3 kids and only talks to the one and that's not me. It's not like she doesn't know who I am, it's just that she doesn't care. Fast forward to now, I live with my grandmother who says that she should've left me and my father on the streets instead of taking us in. I have no contact with my mother or father or siblings. I'm in school I have no friends anymore because of the recent break up with my gf. I just want to let everyone know honestly it's no one's fault why I did this, it's just I'm tired of living.

I have been thinking this for years, sometimes yearning it, sometimes planning it, sometimes just looking at it like a far thing; I've been living through the last 3~4 years just so my family and friends don't have to deal with my death and it has been a nightmare. Psychiatrist to psychiatrist looking for answers and (more importantly) ways to solve my ""depression"", trying different pills and treatments just to end up forwarding me to a ""better"" specialist (or telling me that the only choice is to do an Electroconvulsive Therapy, which, worth mentioning, I did not do and will not do) until I reached the top, the expert among experts, the man who studied his whole life to treat the most fucked up depressions.


All that once gave me life and hope turned into nightmares, a year-long relationship with a girl I dreamt for years and changed my entire life ended up being a borderline disorder and I had to cut it off after being asked by both psychiatrist and family. It was devastating for both and there's no turning back ever again to that.


I never hated myself until that point.


But as you may have guessed, after 2 years of trying any and every pill in the market (which were expensive as hell in this godforsaken land) the psychiatrist ran out of ideas and asked me to stick to the ""anti-suicide"" treatment to wait until something comes up (again) and changes my life.

After realizing that the pills' side effects were destroying my teeth, skin, and bone while doing little to no change in my mental state, I decided to stop all treatment and wait for the best.


Now I feel that there's no way out, the future awaits mostly pain, I have to go to the dentist regularly to fix what the pills did to my teeth (which is a very painful treatment), my skin burns like hell every 3~4 days for reasons unknown and the last person I tried to form a relationship with, asked me plainly to stop.


I see the past and is painful, I see the future and it holds mostly suffering, and the present is hell on earth.

Especially since I've gotten sober 3 years ago.
It seems as if I've lost contact with everybody. When I was high on crank going on a 3 week binger it felt like I was hanging out and having sex with alot more people. (Probably because I was.)

Now all it feels like I do is work 12 hours, Come home and sleep 4.
I recently started talking to this girl at work and it felt like finally I have met someone I have common ground with. Turns out she lied to me, led me on and is more than active sexually. (Hoe-ish). So now that I've told her to fuck off I'm back at square one.
I'm on the fence of self destructing again and throwing everything I've worked for away because what's the point if you're not happy.

Dude I honestly just wanna kill myself. Maybe I'm in a really bad state of mind, but honestly, I don't see the point in living anymore
I know I can get over the situation with my dad, and I know that I will get stronger. But I've said this multiple times before these past 2 years have been hell, and, every time I've gotten over 1 phase of depression, some new tragedy happens in my life. With no exaggeration in only 2 years I've faced over 11 tragedies in my life, I've been suicidal before, and kelpt it to myself, I'm not keeping it to myself now because I'm really on edge
I'm not doing this for attention or for you to feel bad for me. Honestly, I just don't know what else to do. I feel like once my dad dies, even if I become happy again, some new crazy and even bigger tragedy will happen, 11 times I've felt depressed this year thinking EACH TIME ""This is the worst it's ever been I don't think it can get worse"" and all 11 times I've been proven wrong, I'm sick of it. I just wanna die dude, I'm sick of all of this pain. I don't care what my family or friends think. If anyone truly loved me they'd understand that death is the only thing to stop this pain
The worst part is, I have no one to turn to, I feel like no one truly understands how much fucking pain I'm in
I don't know why I'm turning to you, I don't know what you can say, I don't even really want you to say anything. If you want to know where my mind is right now, this is where, if you want to know why I'm not hitting deadlines, it's because I don't even wanna live

I really wanted to do well in college, so I can switch to the school they initially wanted me to go to. I needed at least a 3.5 GPA for a good shot. I worked so hard.

5300,"Current coping strategy - everything is epilogue Things have gotten near unbearable, and my old coping strategy just isn't working anymore, so I tried something new.  It worked today anyway (for the most part).  I can't say it will work tomorrow, buy maybe, and I am definitely going to keep at it.  

First, I decided that things actually will not ever get better, at least through any actions of my own, because I am either incapable of those of actions or will fuck them up and make things worse, or because they are just superficial ways to paper over the real unfixable thing that is wrong.  

Second, and crucially, I decided that things can't really get fundamentally worse either.  I'm already miserable all the waking day, what can life do to me?  Take more things away?  Those things weren't helping.  Add more shame and guilt?  I already see the next avalanche, who cares how fast or slow it gets here?  Take away people I love?  Most have left; the rest are here by familial obligation and are no kind of support system.

It follows that nothing can hurt me anymore!  The external components of my depression have no power; you went too far Depression, now you have no leverage!!  

In a sense, I died.  It was a good life, depression notwithstanding, I'm glad I experienced it pain and all, now it's over, at least in any meaningful sense.  To society: Go ahead and kick that guy, he's not down, he's dead!!  

And because he's dead, I'm not him, I am his ghost.  I wander, do what I will, impervious to the pain, and sometimes there will even be nice moments; that's just gravy on top of the life already lived, and so I still wander, because who knows.  There is no reason for guilt or shame; you're just speaking disrespectfully of the dead when you push it on me.  No reason for loss - everything is gone.  Why are we talking about the dead guy anyway?  We can't help him, he's gone.

Will it work forever?  Doubtful.  But I'm trying it.  I tell no one but Reddit; it's important to keep this secret and sacred, in case it works.  And if it brings back hope thus invalidating itself, well, that's a lot further than where I am now.

Maybe it will help someone; I hope so.  I am a friendly ghost.",depression,ID16780_depression,"

I was using this dating app for gay men, which is full of idiots. I was just lurking, not looking for anything specific, until this guy talked to me. We kept talking for weeks, and I found out that he was pretty much the whole package (in my eyes, of course. He was the first person to make me so interested). The thing is, I got extremely excited, and I think he started losing interest, and that made me frustrated and anxious. I've been feeling really bad. I feel lonely, ugly, stupid and pathetic. 

Today, I checked his Twitter, even though I don't have an account. I saw he wrote something really sweet about somebody, and of course, it wasn't me. It made me feel sadder than I've felt in a long time. I hate myself for feeling like that. I did this to myself, and now  I'm crying, and my chest hurts, and my eyes are red and swollen, and everything hurts. So I went and did something I stopped doing like two years ago. I made three small cuts in my forearm. I had to punish myself for being that stupid. 

Also, tomorrow is my 28th birthday. I should be acting my age, and be a grown man, and take care of myself, but I just can't help but hate myself right now.

2828,"Fantasy World It's a painful pill to swallow knowing I'm 30 years old, unemployed, I haven't worked since 2011 (it's now 2017), and when I did that was only part-time. I've never worked a full-time job.



I'm disabled (with a severe mental illness), still live at home with my parents, no woman, very little socialization, and I sit in my room most of the day.



I missed out on years of socialization and fun, while I was suffering.



I feel like I've wasted my life, and I still am.



I'm addicted to the internet. I make videos and blog post (which I call my ""art""), post on social media, expecting it to make me rich and famous. And I think that's all I need to do to achieve that. However, I've been trying for YEARS. But I'm waiting and nothing's happening. My life is passing me by. I'm getting so frustrated and depressed.



I want someone else to turn all the raw data I've created into information - basically, spoon feed me success. But the chances of someone rescuing me is slim. I have to change my life.



I don't grasp the emotional consequences of doing nothing. The internet fantasy world distracts me from the pain and sadness. Even in my psychiatry sessions, I don't grasp the reality. I want to live in an imaginary world. 



I need to realize it's never going to happen if I don't make it happen. Deluding myself into thinking that Taylor Swift, or a celebrity, or an old friend is watching me is unhealthy. No one will reveal themselves when the time is right in a ""magical moment"". I've had internet chats with anonymous people thinking it was them in disguise. It resulted in me getting duped and I got hurt badly by the deception.



The fantasy world protects me from the sadness that no one is coming to rescue me.



When I'm in extreme emotional pain, thinking ""Taylor Swift"" loves me brings a smile to my face. But recovery lies in facing the real world, as painful as it may be.



I BEG people online to be my friend, to lend a hand. I say: someone, anyone, rescue me soon, please!!!!!!



It's a tough pill to swallow that I have to do it myself. And I fear I won't anytime soon. And I'll wake up at 40 years old having wasted my life.



I don't want to let go of the delusion because it's comforting. Realizing I've wasted my life is too depressing. ",off_my_chest,ID38813_off_my_chest,"

I made it official after two goddamn weeks, and in the end it was all because I didn't want to wait for sex. I didn't let our love develop naturally. After it was official, all I wanted to do was cuddle and fuck. I even ended the passion in our make out sessions wirh it.. you trusted me so much and just ugh, I fucked up so hard. You already had sexual trauma, I should have realized thst you were doing things to make it better with me. I should have kept being your ""daddy""... but instead I got weirded out and sick of it because making out is all I ever wanted to do. I was such a typical trash guy that just wanted sex.. 

Now, due to everything that happened, you're pushed away and I'll never be with you again. I'll never be able to protect you, to hold you in my arms.. I miss you so much. I miss our cuddles and how innocent we were.. I shouldn't have let my friends push me into this mindset of needing sex. I should have been able to wait and let things happen naturally... I should have also let you better me. I should have made a commitment after going to Florida for my cousins wedding that I would stop smoking and start driving.. but I didn't. I kept being a piece of shit and kept hating myself and it made me take it out on you. 

I hate myself. I hate everything. We had a three year build up to this.. and I fucked it all up by being a horny fuckhead. We could have been so fucking great together.. I could have been such a good man for you. But I wasn't. I acted like a kid the whole time we were together and never gave a second thought to you, to actually being a boyfriend.. 

I feel like such a massive fucking piece of shit, Reddit. How could I take advantage of her like that.. god I want to die. All I wanted was for your family to accept me and instead I rushed it all.. I don't want to start over with someone new. I don't want to let myself develop feelings for them and let us take our time. I want you.. I want what we had. I should have been content being your brothers hot friend that you really liked, and been content with us just making out sometimes.. I rushed you into sex with no second thoughts.

I hate thatbi didn't go with your kink. I hate that I lost you. I hate that I pushed you away, and freaked out so hard when ij realized I was losing you.. I got so clingy and annoying.

Depression is just a cop out for an oversensitive first world population that has been taught that they can be and do anything they want and have been grossly under prepared for how shitty the world really is and how much it really doesn't give two shits about their feelings.
Depression in most cases is really just like ADHD it fucking doesn't exist in that person, in most cases it just a person being a coddled little shit who wasn't properly taught how to deal with a shitty world. If a kid is hyper and doesn't pay attention it automatically is assumed to be ADHD if a kid is shy and doesn't communicate well it is automatically assumed to be autism.

3949,"Human nature is really complex. My shift at work tonight started really bad. A group of assholes from the other shift decided to throw some shit at me, as they like to do from time to time. I had a bad luck being their target, usually it's some other poor guy. 

I always try really hard to convince myself to not care, but as you propably know it's pretty much impossible.

Their words always hit me like an atomc bomb. For the next few hours only thing I was thinking about was go home and cry.

When I was talking to them I analyzed their facial expressions, the way they are looking at me and at each other, their body language, and realized that they must have been talking about me behind my back. They always do that to everyone, I see it all the time. It's natural to them, like breathing.

So I just standed there and didn't know what to say. How do you even respond to something like this? I mean, a situation where a group of people is laughing behind your back, then confront you with smirks on ther faces and do everything to make you look, and feel like a piece of shit. And it was not the first time that happen, and with the same exact people. To make things even worse, one of them is their supervisor and not only she doesn't do anything to prevent this. She encourage their stupid shit while clearly having a great time. And don't think I'm biased against them just because they make ME upset. They do this all the time to others and I think it's absolutely wrong, and unaccaptable in every case. Especially in the workplace.

Usually in these kind of situations I try to ignore them and direct their attention away from me which i eventually did.
 
Once they played their ""sophisticated"" psychological tricks on me and had their fun, it was the end of their shift so they walked away, and went home, and I stayed there totally broken and devastated, and started doing my work. I know it may sound like I'm overreacting, but I can't help it. I'm very sensitive to other people words.

Sometimes when I talk to each of them 1 on 1 and nobody is around, if I didn't know better I would think that they are normal people. We have some laugh, talk about some stuff, everything looks normal. But when there are two of them or more together? They shut down their brains, and throw you under the bus without a blink. They do everything for attention, they are so desperate of it, and don't even bother to think for one second what harm are they doing.

My college works on a quarter system, and the winter quarter just started over thanksgiving. I am just going to goof off and not worry about the classes i am taking this quarter, spend time playing videogames and D&amp;D. near the end of the quarter in February I am going to wipe all of my accounts, computers, phone, and other devices, pack all of my stuff, and then I will be done. If I am lucky something will kill me before then, but I haven't been lucky yet.

I know it will hurt people and that is the only reason I haven't done it yet, but I just can't continue

I keep putting it off for various reasons, but now I have a set condition of failing the quarter (failing 1 class means it will be another year in school) and I just lost 20% in one class because I was too depressed to get the first assignment done.

Every party posted on Snapchat or instagram I was never invited to, and it's not like I don't try to be invited. I hang out with lots of other people in my grade at school and get along well with them, yet everytime I try to connect with them outside of school they are busy doing something or at a party without me, and even lie to me about it. The truth is it really hurts. And these people are assholes about it too. For instance there are times almost everyday when my peers mention some brief story of someone doing something funny at a party and laugh about it, or openly create a groupchat naming off people who should be in it, when I'm sitting just a few feet away. Sometimes I'll hear them plan parties, and when I try to join the conversation, the subject changes. I have attended one party this year most likely by accidental invitation. I helped the host so much at the party and got along well with everyone, yet I was never invited to another party again. Don't get me wrong, it's not just about the parties. Senior Spring break is a big deal at my school and EVERBODY goes with friends somewhere, of course except me who was never invited to anything. I still tried to create my own group of people to go do something, but they just weren't interested. I feel my grade is pretty inclusive when it comes to parties and events like that, yet somehow word gets around to even some of the most anti-social students yet somehow avoids me. As far as anxiety pairs into this, it haunts me. My holidays and weekends are ruined. I filter through instagram seeing 'friends' hangout and if I try to text them they don't respond. I get sleepless nights and my anxiety at one point drove me to believe that I was just a bad person, who was annoying to everyone. Now that college admissions are overand school is relaxing, my anxiety is acting up again. I feel so held back on a social level whether that be with girls , talking to peers, or even eating lunch with peers. Even getting accepted into a college didn't feel like an accomlishment, because my anxiety was holding me back My family is very aware of all this and keeps reminding me that college is only a semester and a summer away, but I just can't take it anymore. Sometimes when I'm home alone, I feel the only thing I can do is drive. So I drive around or go run until I calm down. It works for a while, but its not a true solution. I'm lost and don't know where to turn to.",anxiety,ID5757_anxiety,"

Like calling the police/hospital

There's a facebook post going around that's stating that if you're friend is having a mental break and is suicidal, then you shouldn't call the cops/hospital. It claims that you **need** to go over there yourself, or to call their family (which by the way is *the worst possible idea* because a good portion of the time their break may be *caused* by family), or to call a neighbor (Maybe if they are close to a neighbor, but you need to be sure), or to 'call the guy who owns the bar next door' (???? Why would this even be a consideration????). 

Sometimes calling the police/hospital for your friend is the best solution. However, you need to be absolutely sure they are seriously going to hurt themselves. Don't feel bad if you can't make it to your friend, or if you know you can't help them for *whatever* reason. It's not your fault if you need to reach out to someone official to help.

Actually, encouraging your friend to call a suicide hotline if you are unable to stay talking to them is probably a better idea than **anything mentioned on that stupid facebook post**.",off_my_chest,ID21828_off_my_chest,"

My step brother got in contact last night after a month of having me blocked in light of our parents' separation-- I really, really, *really* loathe calling it that, I'm simply unaware of how else to wrap it succinctly. This time around, unlike the phone calls within the past year, it didn't seem like he was well on his way to hammered. ...Though, the conversation basically began and ended with ""call me tomorrow"". Poof! Gone right after. A mild explanation for the blocking, some added bits about his recent jobs, then wrapped up.

He says he wants to speak to my little brother today. On the contrary, my little brother wants nothing to do with him, with any of them, based on the shame. No amount of holding him makes the heaving stop *before* the mention of their want to contact, let alone after. He, long an absolute baby in my eyes, was the one who suggested changing his surname back to mom's maiden name. I don't want to take the choice to talk from him, which I'm not sure our mom would take with ease, but he's struggling. How's that supposed to translate over phone call without it becoming a personal jab? Should it be a personal jab? 

I haven't told my mom nor my brother yet because the people we're staying with would lose their heads quite literally, but there's a distinct weight in how my step father still holds us at financial gunpoint. If he were to know none of us want anything to do with him, if anything were to come out of my step brother's mouth, I fear he'll stay true to that custody battle threat. My luck has taught me to be cautious-- I know he left my step brothers too, I know he did so much of the same to their mother, but he went crawling back to them after us. He lives with them now for christ's sake, and they're happy as can be. I don't trust any confidence in our exchange and I feel horrible on either side. ",off_my_chest,ID18611_off_my_chest,"

1167,"My Medication Journey (23 y/o male, 2 suicide attempts, MDD and GAD) Hello, 

I'm going through my medication journey and I want some advice. I am a 23 year old male university student diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and General anxiety disorder.


for 2.5 years I was taking a combo of Prozac and Wellbutrin XL and it was working for a while. I was able to achieve a GPA of 3.6 in that time. But it sort of became less effective. My doctor decided that I should change and so far hasn't been working so well. 


In no particular order, I was on venlafaxine, lexepro, hydroxyzine, proproponol. 


2017 has not been fruitful for me. I failed both semesters. 2 months ago I had 2 suicide attempts. One was a at a gun range. I rented a gun and tried to shoot myself. I target practiced to get a feel for shooting for some reason. Then I pointed the gun at myself but I froze for a while and couldn't pull the trigger. 


second attempt I was at thanksgiving break. Both my roommates were away for 5 days. I kept getting high to distract myself. But after the 5th day, I was in such a dark mindset that I overdosed on Inderal (proproponol). I ended up talking to my sister before going to sleep (forever). She told me that I should go to the hospital right away or she will call 911. so I went. 


right now, I'm on 150mg of Zoloft and 5mg of Abilify. have been on it for 2 to 3 weeks. I have been feeling generally tired and lethargic. Also very unmotivated. I didn't like how the medication was going, so I asked my doctor. She told me to wait it out since it was too early. 


I am unsatisfied with the medication so far. I don't feel functional at all. I have no choice but to give it time now. Does anyone have any history with this medication or disorders? I would appreciate any advice. 


Thank you. ",anxiety,ID3377_anxiety,"

3929,"I'm too paranoid to post on Reddit. Long time lurker. I was going to go on this long rant about my life but.
I just can't.
I *know* it's probably all in my head, but every time I try to talk about something i get scared. cause if anyone I knew found something like this. I'd probably seize up and die from dread. It probably stems from trust issues but whatever.
It's stupid and I know it.
If i'm lucky this will just get ignored like everything else i do.

EDIT: After getting this off my chest and seeing some supportive comments I half convinced myself to talk about it anyway, So here goes.

When I was a kid my parents left me in care of my aunt and uncle. (cause apparently my mom didn't want to have to deal with diapers or something). And basically from my very early childhood (5-ish) the only things i can remember is being locked in my room and walking around aimlessly in my small room. It wasn't until i started preschool that my parents actually decided to take ownership and i moved. this was when i probably first met my older sister.

From my early elementary years I was a pretty good student I guess. My handwriting was and still is horrible though. My dad used to say things like ""you're horrible"" and ""someday i'm gonna put you in a box and mail you to (where he's from)"". My mom was nice to me, but she was a problem gambler and wasn't really healthy. She spent most of the time in bed or cooking. My older sister (older by  5 years), to me was a role model. She got straight A's and participated in a lot of extracurricular activities and clubs. She was also a great artist

This admittedly is probably the reason why i feel so bad.

Like i said she was my role model, so i wanted to be like her, but it never really worked out. My greats were lower, i wasn't in any clubs. Even when we went to karate school she was always higher up them me, (which is kind of to be expected being she's my seinor). But i really wanted to catch up with her.

I never did, around 5th or 6th grade part of me just kind of gave up, and i started to slack on doing work. It wasn't that i wasn't learning, i just kind of lost the drive to do thing, much to the disappointment of well, everyone (including me).

This kind of continued on, i found that as my sister moved onto highschool and beyond her accomplishments only got more impressive. Her art got better, she was somehow in even MORE clubs (and president of most of them) and she took all of those fancy AP classes and still getting straight As, meanwhile i was just kind of here, flopping.

At some point she was diagnosed with Scoliosis (basically spine bent weirdly) so she stopped karate, and cause she stopped I stopped cause my dad diddn't want to drive.

Eventually my sister left for a College down in Florida, so it was just me and my parents.
after that, my last year in middleschool was probably one of the worst years of my life.

long story short my math teacher was out for maternity leave, so i had a replacement for most of the year. Also around this time i got this huge crush on this girl. Something happened, and she basically ran away crying. I was never really sure what was happened, but i felt like the entire fault lied with me and well. *yeah*. My math teacher came back for like the very end of the year, and to me it seemed like she hated me. Mostly because she would use any excuse to scold me (like yelling ""Pay attention!"" when all i was doing was reaching down to pick up a pen i dropped).

Anyway there was this thing where you could skip a class in highschool if you did good in your math class and the math teacher said you could. Despite tutoring a lot of people and getting the highest scores in the class i diddn't quality, and it was another huge blow to my self esteem and my view on people.

End of the year, summer vacation comes along and well. Some random day that i can't remember

My house caught on fire and my mom died.

It was really confusing, i was like looking through Reddit anonymously when all of a sudden i hear the fire alarm go off. This happens all the time so i shrugged and went to go check, next thing i see is a dancing orange glow out of a frosted glass window. next thing i knew i heard people screaming and like windows breaking. (reminder i'm currently 11). My body kind of went on autopilot and i ran out the front door. Then for some reason i realized *i'm probably going to lose stuff* So i ran back inside the burning building. The smoke burned my eyes and i forgot what i was really doing, i grabbed some games nearby and ran back out, too embarrassed to say what i was doing.
My dad was at work but my mom was in bed, so when they got her out, they rushed her to the hospital to treat her for burns. her throat closed up along the way and she suffocated. after things settled a bit i got to see her in the hospital, dead. a bunch of mess happened with family and then after a while spending the summer with relatives, summer was over.

Now i had to not only adapt to a new address which was quite far away, but *also* start my first year at highschool.

It wasn't much better then middle school admittedly.

Almost all my teachers said to me ""Hey you're X's sibling right?"" Yeah, ""cool she was a great student i can't wait to see what you can do"". Needless to say, i diddn't really live up to her legacy. The first few classes i took pretty blatantly mirrored her class choices, and one of them was art. Forcing myself, someone who has no artistic talent into an art class went basically as you would expect. I tried to join the same clubs she did but, it just diddn't work out. i ended up taking art for two years. both of them were miserable. My english grades were still pretty abyssmal and despite still being good in math, not doing homework meant that those stellar test grades diddn't really mean much. plus the feeling of being screwed over by my 8th grade teacher kind of made me bitter towards math as a subject entirely.

My junior year was pretty nice, i finally found some niche where i didn't feel completely suffocated by the legacy of my older sis. Music and specifically, singing. I also enjoyed writing and even won some of the annual school contests, whenever i worked up the courage to submit.

i'm a senior in highschool now and the whole college ordeal has basically killed my spirit. I've come to terms that i'll never beadle to be my sister (who now has her masters and is working and making decent money). But it seems i was too stupid to realize sooner. To put it bluntly due to my lack of motivation i completely destroyed my grades and, consequently, any hope i really have of getting in a college i want. I still consider myself to be very proficient in maths and literature, but i just have no motivation. The only thing i really have passion is Singing and maybe writing and well, i'm not talented enough to make a career out of that. so i really have no idea what to do with my life and i feel like i just watched my entire life get ruined by myself and it's all my fault.

I have to stop here cause i'm crying so much and i can't let anyone see me like this.",off_my_chest,ID18618_off_my_chest,"

2889,"Palpitations have made me miserable I've suffered from some form of anxiety since I was 16. I'm now 26 and this past year has been hell, save for two or three months of apathy.  It started with this feeling of not getting enough oxygen which sent me to the ER and netted nothing. Since then I've been there with chest pain, arm pain and palpitations.  My blood pressure has been high this year as well, doctor put me on Propranolol, though I think it shoots up when I go to hospital/doctor because I've developed so much anxiety around being in these places now. Oddly enough these palps seem to have really started after I started taking the meds, which is odd because they're also used to *treat* palpitations - even more frustrating! My most recent visit to the ER was once again do to palpitations, which have been bothering me since the Friday before Thanksgiving and only seem to be getting worse. The sensation has given me this sense of incoming doom and dread and I just look at every tinge of pain in my chest as a confirmation of this. I'll be in a room and it's 75 degrees and yet I feel cold. I hate all of this. I've had so many EKGs done this year it's sickening -- all fine save for a so-called ""misreading"" from the computer on one, but the doctor said it was fine. I've also had X-rays and multiple forms of blood work - nothing.  The most recent doctor must've seen I'm reaching my wit's end with the depression; I'm just so utterly exhausted and now I don't know when and when not to go to the hospital because while I'm terrified of the sensations, I'm completely worn out of going, being prodded and poked, getting all anxious thinking they're going to find something and then being sent home with no answers. The most recent ER visit did lead me to get a cardiologist appointment (Jan 10th ugh), despite her saying all their tests were clean, I guess to make sure. I also have a follow-up with my primary cause my white cell count was elevated a bit on the last visit, but the doctor thought it was due to stress. Any and all advice or whatever would be helpful. I don't know what to do and I'm afraid I'm just going to end up back at the hospital. In the evenings, my head will feel like it's on a bobble and like my body is just on vibrate. I get this feeling of lightheadedness, but it's not really veritgo...it's more like an uneasy feeling I can't explain.

You're actually quite unfunny. Nobody likes you, here's the thing *Name* nobody likes you. People just tolerate you. Nobody would miss you if you disappeared."" And this is my friend of 7 years! He doesn't know about how I feel, that's been kept to myself. But if even he's picking up on it, it must have some form of truth. But anyway, I don't know why I feel like this and I don't want to, but I also recognise that life is shit and I don't want to take part in it. I don't really know why im typing this. Presumably cause I'm feeling like shit and it's 2:30 in the morning but either way.

3438,"Welp, i've just become suicidal. My life has been shit for the last 5 years or so, but i always managed. I wasn't happy, but i wasn't sad either. The word 'meh' summarizes it perfectly. Even though i wasn't happy, i never thought of death. But then, a couple of months ago, i noticed that i started thinking shit like ""Man, i wish i was dead"", but never ""i want to die"". 

That went on for a while, but yesterday was the first time i actually started to think about suicide. I thought about it for a long time, how i would do it, where, when (new years), what kind of messages would i leave behind, what i would write in them specifically, what i would do in my last days, etc. 

When i thought about it, i was terrified. What if i were to actually do it? At that moment, i felt sad, scared, i felt self pity, etc. But it felt good. It felt REALLY good. Those feelings of sadness, of fear, made me feel more alive than i can even remember. They felt more deep than the shallow happiness i feel from watching a youtube letsplay, or something similar. It was an addictive sort of sadness.

5432,First post long life story The worlds been working against me from the start it seems. i was molested as a child multiple times by multiple people. beaten by my father and bullied by my siblings. ive never had very many friends or people i could rely on. parents divorced when i was 9 moved to another state. constantly bullied at school treated like shit by my grandparents i had to live with because we had no money. family is super religious and im an atheist so they spend all their time trying to convert me. got my first job at 16 and put almost all my money into bills to help my mom while my siblings did fuck all. in the last 5 years things have gotten really bad. my ex fiance of 4 years dumped me and then i found out she had been cheating on me the entire time. my mother lost her job in the nursing field and couldnt get another thanks to false accusations of abuse. my depression and anger gets so bad i constantly quit jobs or got fired because i worked my ass off and got sick of everyones laziness. 2 years ago my appendix had to be removed because it was close to bursting. i had no job and no insurance so that put me over 27k in debt which just gets higher and higher every month thanks to bill collectors. recently i took a trip to kansas with my family and ended up staying  with my best friend in a shed outside of his friends house. i have no job no money no skills terrible pains in my legs i really only have 2 friends. my family just  wants me to get a job and send my mom money because now that im not paying all the bills shes getting worse. but they just smoke weeds and drink and steal her food and use her just like they used me. tried going to doctor. took my pills. but they never did anything. i scored like 28 on the depression sheet and doctors just ignore when i tell them about my leg pain always blaming depression on it. i look at the world and i just dont want to be apart of it. all the greed and hate theres so little good in the world. i cant stand pain so killing myself just isnt feesable for me. my friends solution to my depression is to tell me im not sad and to hit me and laugh. i dont even know why im typing this so i guess this is it.,depression,ID18914_depression,"

I've been applying to places, but nothing. I'm pretty sure the biggest reason why is because I just don't follow up with a call. it could be argued that i'm lazy and don't remember, but when I do, I just have a hard time trying to make the call. I know what to say in my head, and I've done it before, but it still doesn't get any easier.


the other day I remembered that I applied somewhere, and tried to do a follow up call. hearing the phone ring made my heart pound, and afterwords, I wanted to cry a bit because of how scared I was during the whole time.


semi related, I gotten an interview just once, and didn't get the job. my mom talked to the person who interviewed me, and they told her it's because since I didn't know anything and had no experience, they didn't hire me, despite it being an entry level job.


You could argue it's my mom's fault for being there, but according to her, it's because I'm so quiet and don't talk loud enough is why.

She will also treat me like I'm a disappointment just like my father does. I honestly don't remember the last time we ever had a loving, fun, and happy moment together. I don't think it will ever happen. My father never said he loved me, only in texts he did but never in real life. My mother said she loved me but never meant it. I've had friends in real life but I soon got homeschooled because people where talking about me behind my backs and the school pretty much sucked. The only person I could trust was my best friend, Maylee. But I stopped seeing her after I got homeschooled. I pretty much stopped being social. I talked to people I only knew on the Internet though. But I soon quit after I got catfished, lied to, and other personal reasons. Then I was and still am completely not social to anyone. I mean I only knew my family but I'm always in my room just alone. No one to talk to. No friends. My grandma gets a little mad at me because of that and she gets mad at my brother too. My older brother is pretty much just like me and doing the same things but he lives with my grandparents.

No one tells me to keep going and never give up except for my family that lives states away. I never saw them but some people tell me they love me and I shouldn't give up and that they believe in me. It makes me happy but then everyday something bad happens. Christianity and my future is probably the only things keeping me alive right now. I was going to hang myself today but I wanted to get help. I just want to know I'm loved, that I'm special, and that this world needs me.

I was on that from 18-22, and eventually dropped off it because I no longer had even fleeting thoughts of suicide (which had gone from ending to escapism), and because it was *very* expensive. Turns out, I can orgasm without making a sacrifice to a god when I’m not on it (which it wasn’t supposed to inhibit in the first place)!

So I’m enjoying orgasm life and I think I’m doing pretty well just with coping skills - I don’t dwell on past interactions as much, don’t dread over upcoming interactions with authority so bad, and don’t feel so guilty about doing anything I see a negative to (like driving anywhere contributes to climate change). Then I see a new doctor, since I was getting a bit old to still see a pediatrician.

I had to fast for routine blood tests, and I get sungry. Sungry is like hangry, but sad. Like, “I want to curl up into a ball and cry until you feed me” sad (doc says I’m just very sensitive to blood sugar changes and just need to have frequent, smaller meals through the day). Since I have a history of depression and anxiety, he has me do the questionnaire. After 20 minutes of interaction and the results, he says, “I think you’d be a good candidate for a mild mood stabilizer,” and later, “I’ve been doing this for 27 years and, having known you for 20 minutes, I can tell you have an anxiety disorder.”

It was so... crushing. I thought I was functioning well, almost neurotypical. I didn’t think it was very obvious. I thought I’d made so much progress... but to suggest going back to no-orgasm land? I mean, between that and suicidal urges I’ll take the no orgasms, but... I dunno, it just feels like all the progress I’d thought I’d made was a sham. It made me cry when the nurses finally took my blood, which worried them a bit. I keep telling myself it was just being sungry, and my fiancée agrees, but he’s got to be biased, right? It’s just... :(

I had been going to therapy, but we no longer had a goal, so it was rather pointless. And while I have nothing wrong with taking medications for life (I take propranolol for my tachycardia and Claritin D for my allergies every day), I really enjoy being able to orgasm so easily.

TL;DR Thought I was functioning at near-neurotypical level without medication after a history of medication, new doc suggests medication on the first visit.",anxiety,ID25138_anxiety,"

4081,"I'm a stalker. And I fucking hate it.
I can't just ""like"" someone. I have to figure out EVERYTHING about their lives, their loved ones, where they went to school, who they dated, what their aunt's pet cat is called, the license plate of the car their mother drives, EVERYTHING.
It started when I was in high school. I always liked figures of authority, so I guess high school teachers were the perfect breeding ground for me?? Within a few weeks I had found out everything about each and every mingle ""crush"" I had, which was only limited to teachers by that point. Their wives, their children, their homes, their numbers, everything. Weird thing is, I never acted out the act of calling their phones or stalking them outside in the bushes. I didn't want to do that, and I don't want to do it now.

It's just so weird? I see one of them driving a car, I instantly spot the license plate and repeat it in my head up until the point I am home and can write it down. I had a LIST. A list with every single one's license plates. That's anothe thing, I made lists for everything. I had a list called ""teachers"", where in bullet points were the names, a photo (was pretty good at finding photos, not taking though, of every single one), and every detail of info I had on them.

I don't know why I did it! I just don't know. I kept thinking to myself, it will pass once you go to college and grow up. It didn't. I still do that, only with teachers. I've never had a crush on anybody outside of teaching personnel, never had a boyfriend, and likely never will once he finds out what a freak I am.

I guess that's what I wanted to get off my chest. I have no fucking clue what the matter with me is, but all I want is to stop caring about 'what if he reveals the name of his second son today so I can write it down' and just live my life.",off_my_chest,ID1381_off_my_chest,"

3317,"My story with depression. Hi. I'm a girl from Finland. And I would finally like to tell someone my story. 

It all started when I was 6 years old. i was in kindergarten. It was the year this boy started to bully me. They started by just calling me names and these kind of things like Fat, Ugly, Stupid, Weird and Wimp. When it was winter they started to sharpen the ice sticks and push them to my neck while trying to catch me. I wasn't fit. I was pretty fat to be honest. They always caught me and just tried to kill me (that's what ppl who i've told told me). The boy who bullied me had a really big group of friends and he was 'the king'. I just cried because of the boy. 

Then we started elementary school. And of course the same boy had to come to the same class for another 6 years. I have always been a happy girl and I loved studying. They tore it down. My passion. I wanted to become a doctor and a mother but I guess I really can't. So 2nd grade I was diagnosed with Epilepsy, but thankfully it was the kind that could be cured. But still I tried to keep it a secret but teachers didn't really care and it got out. I was bullied for having an illness I couldn't control?! I had doctors appointments like every 3 months. And I had to start medication and it just got up and up. Then in 4th grade I realized I liked my bully. And now I regret that. It got out and hey! Another reason to bully that girl!! The bullying never stopped.

5th grade it got worse. I would go home crying almost every time. I felt like I was falling apart. My parents asked me if I have depression. I didn't know what that even was and I screamed NO!! and started crying. I just continued living and without realizing started developing the symptoms of depression. If I only have realized that then it wouldn't have gotten worse. 

In 6th grade I just started to make new friends from this summer camp I was at. This one boy who was my age was just perfect (at least I thought so). I liked him and he liked me back. We started dating in September. We broke up in November of the same year because he didn't like me anymore and ignored me and never replied. So we broke it off. He called me a whore and told me he never even liked me. That was it. I was broken. I told my friend and she suggested cutting. I tried. It wasn't bad. i got so used to it and so addicted I couldn't stop even if I tried. So i continued. Looked up good cutting tools. It was the first time I realized I really wanted to die. And that was about the time when I first attempted to kill myself. It didn't work of course. I cried and cried. i haven't been truly happy since then. This one suicide attempt got really bad and they hospitalized me. I had this friend who I trusted and told everything to. i shouldn't have. He told everyone else. And that's when I was being called ""Cutter"", ""Attention Seeker"", ""Worthless"" and told to ""Just kill yourself no one wants you here"". I was torn in pieces. 

Then there was 7th grade next. In the summer this boy sexually assaulted me and touched my private parts without permission and stuff. But not anymore of that. I'm glad I screamed when he tried to take my clothes off. And this other dude just grabbed my butt out of nowhere idk why but it happened

I have tried to kill myself so many times I stopped counting already. I have been hospitalized 3 times and 2 were last year. Last year a month before christmas I was hospitalized because they thought I was gonna kill myself. And the second time was when I was at school and tried to slit my throat but this popular girl came in and told the teacher. And I was sent to the hospital only to wait for 4 hours to get hospitalized AGAIN. 

Current mood: I am still suicidal af and I guess I forgot to tell you but I have a psychiatrist who I talk to every week. And I'm at the risk of getting hospitalized again. I tried to kill myself last night but I lost the blade. I did some damage to my throat but not enough. Then I couldn't get out of bed today and just skipped school. And yeah. This is a short version of my life

Thank you who ever read this,

3639,"TMS I posted this in r/bipolar, but I thought I would share here too.

I just finished 30 sessions of TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation). It uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the brain in regions associated with depression. Its used for treatment resistant depression. The sessions last 40 minutes, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. I now start the taper phase, which is 2 days a week for 3 weeks. I've seen a few people ask about it, so I thought I would share my experience. 

The first few days were uncomfortable, but thwn I got used to it. It feels like a tapping on your skull. The machine is pretty loud, but they have earplugs available if you want them. You just sit in a chair that looks like a dentist chair, I watchef TV during the sessions. When I started I was thinking about suicide pretty much non stop. In my 2nd week I felt like I was actually getting worse. I told the TMS tech and she said that isn't unusual. By the 4th week I was starting to feel better. The suicide ideation pretty much went away. I went from sleeping 14 hours a night to sleeping 7. I don't want to get my hopes up too much, but it seems to be working. 

The only side effect was a mild headache, which I got after most sessions. Not everyone gets headaches. I was skeptical when mt doctor suggested it, but I am glad I did it. My insurance covered it, so I figured I had nothing to lose. It was a big time commitment, but I was so depressed it wasn't like I was doing anything else anyway. It at least gave me a reason to get out of bed. 

If you have been thinking about it, and your insurance covers it (it is like 12 thousand dollars without insurance) I would recommend looking into it. I'm optimistic about these results lasting (or at least I hope they do).",depression,ID13660_depression,"

So, I used to play the guitar with my dad who lived for the guitar. Well, I quit. Some time later, he killed himself. I think my zero interest in music was a reason, but I was a child and I know it's not my fault. Just hurts that now I got at least the same big obsession as him. :/

Anyways, I've wanted to start an instrument for years but I was too afraid of teachers and whatsoever. Now, piano. This was the big dream. I got so much motivation thanks to a piece of art I went to the local music school and got a envelope and fucking hell yes the train was rollin'.

Until.

I was too afraid.

Yeah. Nice. Piano's are freaking expensive and I have health problems with my tendons and yeah fuck this shit and teachers and holy crap. You name it.

So ... another year passed and I decided to start guitar because it's not that expensive and esp not that expensive to quit on if it doesn't work out.

I got a teacher and yes this thing changed my life. I love the guy and he knew my dad. I feel like it's very important to him that I play the guitar. I dunno.

BUT I DUNNO I WANT TO PLAY THE PIANO. :((((((((( FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKk 

I can't listen to piano pieces anymore because I literally get ""depressed"". I feel like I make a big mistake. I like the guitar, I really do, but I feel way more in bond with the piano. I don't want to quit, but I want the piano. But it's expensive. And also the teacher. Also my father. Also ... fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

SO WHAT NOW? If I quit now, and I need to if I decide to because I can't wait longer, it'd hurt the guy... you see I'd just prefer it to do piano professional and the guitar casual, but it doesn't work with lessons for both, because money.

I guess one year later I'll hate myself for it but ... but what. I dunno. No idea. Zero.

You see, I'm .. lost? Anyone with some tips for a goner? :( I'm a bit panicking because tomorrow I should bring the contract to the teacher (after a month) and weeeeeeeeeeeeeeell it'd be shit to give it to him and THEN quit.

5441,"Sliding further and further into anger and depression - need to get it off my chest - Sorry, probably not very interesting There is a ton of shit that is building up in me that has turned me into a miserable, angry wretch. I don't know whether this is a thing that most late-20s dudes go through or if most of it is my own shitty, entitled personality. But I think writing about some of it would be therapeutic, so here I go.

I'm in my mid-late 20s. I live in a town where I don't know anybody and I can barely have conversations even with my coworkers because we have nothing in common. I go to work, come home, distract myself with whatever then go to bed. I'm still a virgin because I'm an idiot who is only attracted to people after I've known them 4-5 years and the chance is long past gone. It's not their fault at all, but my tendency to do this frustrates me. I also straight up haven't been remotely attracted to anyone in like 5 years while my peers have kids and get married.

I am pretty blessed with having some good friends. But I've been the emotional bedrock for so much of their goddamn negativity. For some reason I become the go-to guy to complain about their everything under the sun. When I try to do the same, 9 times out of 10 I'm met with immediate disinterest. Sometimes I've even been told to ""man up"". My own father once told me I was acting like a little b- when I tried to tell him I was feeling depressed. I can't rely on people to provide the same service that I get forced into for so many others. Getting close to people now feels like a chore.

I have trouble tuning things out. I like to absorb. It's difficult for me to find sleep when a lot of the things I absorb indicate that the world is beyond fucked. Everyday, thousands of senseless murders and rapes happen. Two of some of the deadliest mass shootings in America happened back to back. Car terrorism is on the rise. ISIS burns people alive in cages. Boko Haram uses young women as suicide bombers. Perfectly good people get cancer or suffer accidents for little reason. We have access to information about so much awful shit happening that there's just an overload and no one gives a shit.

The amount that no one collectively gives a shit is palpable. No one I know - even the nice and friendly people - regularly donates anything to any cause just out of pure laziness. On a macro level - billionaires and giant corporations could handily massively improve the world, but instead chase only profit and billionaires hide their incomprehensible amounts of money offshore to avoid paying taxes. Because god forbid they have 19 billion instead of 20 billion. It is unbelievable how much people are unwilling to part with things if it meant they'd only be holy-shit rich instead of holy-FUCK rich. The amount of apathy and pure lack of compassion that so many of the most powerful have has just shattered my faith in humanity. So many beautiful acts on the local level are just crushed because the system is so broken on higher levels.

I chose to get more into politics when we elected the literal embodiment of everything wrong with America. That has turned out to be a mistake. Headline after headline pisses me off with new levels of callousness and apathy from our administration - whether they want to take healthcare from millions to make billionaires richer, or add a trillion to our deficit to make billionaires richer. And so many people just eat it up - or go the smug ""above it all"" route of ""both sides are the same...why even bother bro."" When pressed that no, one side is flawed and the other is a pure festering pile of garbage, they have no argument but refuse to take the step to learn more or possibly see that their ""enlightened"" apathy is anything but harmful to the nation.

But it's not all bad. I have friends, a job I kinda like, a sweet-as-pie mother, and a good brother. But I look into the future and I see nothing. Just a void where I get angrier and angrier at shit I can't control and continue to slowly unravel as I waste my 20s being pissed and depressed.

Thanks and sorry for the incoherence.

How did you understand that something was not ok with you? 
I have been feeling sad for like 3 years now. It sometimes fade, but now its only becoming worse. I really cant understand what is going on with me.. 
home - school - home
its like all i could do, because i feel so tired after even stepping out of my bed. I cant sleep at nights, i have tried all kinds of teas, natural sleep enhancers, nothing really helps. I have tried not sleeping for 24 h just so i could go to bed normally, it didnt work either, i couldnt sleep at night anyway. my grades are getting lower just because im sleepy at school and cant really concentrate.
I cant really find any motivation to get up in the weekdays. 

about a year ago I met a boy who means the world to me, he made me so much happier just with his existence, his smile, his jokes
I hadnt told him about my sadness, because i thought that it wouldnt come back again, and as i had expierienced before, everybody just leaves when you tell them that, i dont blame them, but i do miss them.
But then this hit me again. I pushed him away. After that i apologized about that and decided to talk to him about that, because i didnt want to lose him at all. i thought he would try to understand me, understand my emotions, my overreactingand it actually broke me even more. he said that i havent been the positive girl that he met lately, that he doesnt need such negativity in his life. 

 I dont really want to give up on my life, i could never do that to my mom, shes the only one keeping me alive, but neither i want to just exist

4134,"I have no motivation or friends Hi. This is going to be a long rant. Sorry if this is not the place to post this. I just need to get it out of my head.  
  
I am 20 and currently in my second year of college. I am facing the likely outcome that I will be, at a minimum, suspended for a year because of my bad grades. My parents are great and I love them a lot, but they will rightfully be very disappointed and pissed off. I am not looking forward to that conversation.  
  
My main problem is that I have no motivation to do anything. My floor is a pile of laundry that I have needed to do for days. I am out of food so I just don't eat. I don't even play video games. Most importantly, I don't go to class or do my homework. The worst part is that I know this is a problem, I just can't do anything. I am very stressed, yet I just sit and look at reddit all day. I used to be smart. I had a 4.0 and I liked school. Then halfway through high school, something happened. I stopped doing my homework and I started failing. I went from being three years ahead in math, to having to take calc 1 for the 4th time when I get back from suspension.  
  
Another big problem are my social skills. I have always been a very shy and quiet person. I used to have a lot of friends though. But overtime we started to grow apart. They met people that actually talked to them. I started to be invited less and less. I still get invited sometimes for big group stuff, but being at a college a few hours away I only see them a few times over breaks. No one texts me, but to be fair I don't text anyone either.  
  
I have had a hard time making friends here at college. At first I was nervous because wasn't going to know anyone, but at the same time I was excited for a fresh start. It started off well though. I made a friend at orientation and I joined the robotics club (I used to be a CS major). I mainly hung out with the robotics team at first, but then my friend from orientation invited me to hang out with some friends that he made. I was splitting my time between the groups but after a couple months I realized that I was not having much fun with the robotics team and a few of the guys were dicks. So I quit the team and started hanging out with my other friends full time. By second semester however, the group was down to mainly me and two other people. The two other people were roommates so we would hang out in their room. There was a big problem though. They both played video games, and I did not. I like video games, but I was never allowed to play them much and I only had a DS. My friends also still had friends from high school that they played games with and talked to. So most of my time was spent sitting in their room watching them play games or reading reddit. But we got along and I did not have any other friends so now we live together. I worked over the summer and I got a pc. I was hoping for a better year.  
  
Of course that could not happen though. My one roommate joined a club and spends most of his time there so now he only plays once in a while with his old friends, and my other roommate has stopped playing video games. We don't have much else in common so beside occasionally watching YouTube or Netflix together I spend most of my time alone in my room. I have not met anyone with the same interests as me. Not many people want to go to a football game and play video games. And being at a kind of party school, it is even harder to find someone that also doesn't get drunk/high every night.

Suffice it to say that it's been a very stressful year on so many fronts, and it's not over. And on top of that, I quit all my drugs (good decision so far) and my therapist went on maternity and declined to return. 

I'm actually doing quite well, all things being equal. Except my new issue. I was on latuda for a little more than 3 years. I noticed when I started it, my sex drive came down closer to what seemed ""normal."" It was nice. Of course, I quit the latuda. At the moment, I've felt like crap all week, today being the worst. I wish I would just get the flu and be done with it instead of this drawn out bullshit. But I'm going to have to find a way to seduce my husband anyway, because I don't think I'll be able to go to sleep in this state. I mean, I know guys have boners, and it's embarrassing, but this is tough too. Unless I'm mistaken, the clitoris is quite long into my belly, so I can feel this kind of fullness in the arousal, from deep. Somewhat distracting but mainly unwelcome. I'm tired, and married, and my days of taking care of this with a boyfriend and two side pieces are over. 

Emailed my doctor to see if he'd give me a low dose of effexor just to take the edge of my sex drive. Earlier this year, it in addition to the latuda, it basically eliminated my sex drive for several months. This almost seems more frustrating, haha! I wonder if I can even it out a little.

2511,"Suicidal thought buildup I get regularly depressed; it's been that way for a really long time. And until this past few months I've managed to keep it under control. I pushed myself out of bed, showered, went to class, swam as a workout, etc. I graduated last summer and moved in with my girlfriend (she's wonderful).

But, as of now I have had a lot of job submissions and interviews but have landed nothing. As everyone is aware, living is expensive, and I've seen my bank account just chip away as I look around for employment. I can barely afford the basics for my girlfriend and myself. And those old thoughts, those deep dark *sad* thoughts, have caught up with me. Those thoughts that *you're worthless* or *you can't do anything right*, creep up on me even when I'm doing fine.

Simple critiques of me just have devastating effects: I lose my sense of hunger, I don't sleep; thinking of what I did wrong, my everyday motivation and creativity just evaporate. Then those feelings make me less social and more irritable and then I realize I'm not treating people as well as I should be... The cycle continues in this negative feedback loop.

And it's just accumulating to a point where I find myself thinking about killing myself on a regular basis. I know that ending my life will be a living nightmare for those that I love and care about. It will follow my parents, my brother, my girlfriend and her family, and my friends until they die.

But I just *can't* keep going on like this. I'm probably not giving my wonderful girlfriend the love she deserves. Right now all I feel is that deep gut hurt, the empty feeling that just sucks color away from life. I just need help. Maybe a little space and a soft cry will help. I honestly didn't think I would be showing my thoughts anywhere, especially on the internet. To whomever is reading this, thank you. I hope you are OK.

1353,"Sometimes I get so overwhelmed with rage I can’t think of another way out but to blast myself. My life has been this horrible, shitty, tragic shit show for the last three years (I’ve suffered with depression for over 15 years but went undiagnosed forever) and I just feel like there is no way out of this. Some people I know call me “karmas punching bag” because I’m a good person but bad things always keep happening to me. Not to keep a list of bad things on hand, but in the last three years I have suffered with addiction, gotten a dui which was involuntary because some asshole drugged me at a house party, lost my amazing job, broken 3 ribs and lost my other amazing job and future career as a carpenter because of it, my boyfriend and soulmate killed himself, after saving my life when I attempted, for which I carry immense guilt. I’ve been going through so much and struggling so hard to be healthy and do all the right things and it’s like clock work, this inevitable set back, after set back. I moved home with my mom after breaking my ribs because I wanted to go back into health care and get the job I’d lost because of my dui back, so I accrued 8 grand in debt so I could pay my re licensing and blow box fees, buy a car, pay for insane insurance rates (700$) a month and get back on my feet. Since then my online banking has been hacked, someone tried to steal all what was left of the money I had, luckily they caught it but it fucked up a bunch of direct deposit bills and It ended up costing me like over 100$ in fees and overdraft even though it wasn’t even my fault, then after jumping through all the hoops to get my license back I go in to take my road test and there’s an error because I had briefly lived in another province and 5 months after the fact they decided in the middle of me struggling to get relicensed they would switch it over, so I had to wait even longer. FINALLY after all that I’ve got my blow box and conditional license back, and my old
Job (all good things but wait there’s more) so now I’m driving today and for no reason when I park my car and turn off the ignition my alarm goes off and my blow box stops working and I’ve been on hold with technical support for over 4 hours with absolutely nothing, elevator music for 4 hours straight. It’s -27 outside and snowing and the mechanic is closed so I can’t get it checked out and of course I’m meant to have my first day back at my old job and now I can’t even drive, which I need to do for community nursing. 

I just don’t even know if I can take this anymore. It’s just one shot after another, life just will not cut me a break. I don’t even have it in me to get up after getting knocked down so many times. 

I’m honestly thinking about killing myself tonight, I don’t have anyone to talk to, I don’t have any hope... I’m just done.

543,"Post gallbladder removal anxiety Hi all,

I had my gallbladder out a week ago. The surgery went fine and I was able to get through it with little nausea and no vomiting! (Thank you so much for antiemetic drugs and scopolamine patches!). While the surgery itself is healing okay, I'm starting to get worried and freaked out about lasting effects.

Basically I've been having a lot of intense diarrhea. Anytime I eat anything it seems I'm in the bathroom very shortly with intense diarrhea. I get pretty nauseated and gassy before and then have to run to the bathroom.

This whole thing has got me freaked out because I'm terrified it's going to somehow develop into throwing up somehow. I even called the nurse to check in with her about it and she told me to give it a few more days, stay hydrated, and eat as bland as I can. It's too soon to really tell if the even more bland eating is helping, but I'm terrified it won't. Post op appointment is on Monday.

To people who have had their gallbladders out - did you experience this? They did tell me to expect some diarrhea, but I'm terrified this is something different. I need to force myself to stay off of google more, but of course I've been on there freaking out... seeing everything from it's normal and it will pass in a few weeks to it's life long to pancreatitis and cancer.

I have been so incredibly stressed and scared from this entire situation. I was so hopeful that once I had the surgery my anxiety would ease up a bit... I'm not sure that happened :( My doctor even prescribed me a months worth of klonopin to help get me through.

I was ashamed because the morning after, his girlfriend (who I didn't know he had) showed up at the apartment, and he ignored me, and I felt used and betrayed but also like I was a bad person.

1067,"In Need of Reassurance... Bipolar + Hallucinations Hi all. 2.5 years ago I was diagnosed with Bipolar Type 1 with rapid cycling. Recently I've been experiencing some new symptoms, most notably I've started to have what my psychiatrist describes as hallucinations. It's more just the feeling that there is a bad spirit presence in my apartment, and it has caused me to become very afraid of my bedroom and cat. Last night I had a full-blown panic attack about it.

I'm wondering if anyone else has had experience with Bipolar and hallucinations, and if so how did you deal with them? I feel like I'm kind of starting to lose my marbles.

As far as meds go, I take 1500 mg Lithium, 80 mg Latuda, 50 mcg Levothyroxine, and 20 mg Amitriptyline.",bipolar,ID42401_bipolar,"

5446,"So many physical symptoms Hello all,

My first post here, I've been reading for a while though. Im 21 male, I've had anxiety for the past 6 months or so, and the physical symptoms have really started to get to me.

I have an almost 24/7 symptom of feeling unsteady. Not necessarily dizzy, just off balance. I also have recently been feeling on/off numbness or tingling in my legs, feet, and arms for a few days. Also when the anxiety is worse I find it difficult to breathe, like a tightness in my back and ribs, as well as heart palpitations.

Sometimes I can feel these symptoms all at the same time, other times individually. I've seen my GP and my cardiologist several times and have been to the ER several times and tests have come back clean and am told its my anxiety. I've been on Cymbalta 30mg for a little over a week now and haven't noticed an improvement.

Unfortunately the anxiety was so bad over the summer that I did not leave my house very often and pretty much did not exercise at all. My parents tell me that the numbness in my legs could be a circulation issue which doesn't help since I have a habit of looking up symptoms and thinking I have peripheral artery disease or some bullshit, but I have been trying to exercise more.

I have been trying to stop myself from Googling symptoms because I know it makes it so much worse but sometimes its just unbearable because I experience these symptoms often times when I'm not feeling anxious.

I know just from being on this sub that some of these symptoms are very common but it would make me feel better if I knew I wasn't the only one who gets multiple symptoms at once that can last hours and often get them when I'm not really feeling anxious. Any advice, help, or reassurance would make my day a whole lot better.

Thanks.",anxiety,ID36761_anxiety,"

4259,"Life is excruciating I'm 18. Life just feels like a miserable cycle of depression, misery, anxiety, anger, stress and nothing seems to really fulfill me. I feel i was born and i'm forced to live like this and i don't want to. 

I haven't done anything in my life to make my parents proud-in fact i probably made their lives even worse. My dad didn't even want kids in the first place. Now don't get me wrong-my parents do love me and i would probably kill myself already if they didn't. But they seem like they care less and less every day.

I just feel like such a piece of shit, like i shouldn't have been born in the first place. I lack emotions and i lack any will to do anything. I don't have any motivation to do anything with my life. I feel like i'm never gona find love, because of a lot of stuff that are wrong with me. I'm ugly as fuck. Like i have to be realistic. I'm just an ugly guy. I'm pretty cold. You know like, there are some guy that are ugly as fuck but at least they have something interesting about them that is attractive, they're charismatic, maybe they have a lot of money. I don't have anything interesting about me, i'm awful, broke, depresesed, miserable. No one wants that.

Apart from life circumstances being shitty and me not having real friend any time in my life, being poor my whole life, i also find life to be uninteresting. At least the life im living. The people that are my friends are not my real friends. They don't really care. I'm realizing that more and more and it hurts. Becausd i thought that at least i had a few friends. NOPE. No friends. No one. I'm completely alone, and that doesn't help either. 

This entire week i been thinking about doing it, i been thinking of what to do and how to do it. I will like to experience everything that i possibly can before dying. 

I thought of just dying by dehydration. Like just starving and not drinking anything and waiting to die. I think that is a okay way to go. I haven't seen anyone with this idea tho. I thought about just going somewhere in a forest with some stuff there. Maybe some pills that will help numb the pain if i experience any. And then just waiting for my organs to fail.

I'm not afraid of death to be honest. I just feel that life isn't for everyone and some people just shouldn't be here and that's okay. It's really sad. I wish we lived in a different world where there's no mental illnesses, no cancer, no stupidity, selfishness, people being pieces of shit, poverty and all other awful things that are a part of this life. 

hanks to everybody who bothered to read this, btw im from serbia and not murica. Everybody who read this would be the first person to actually care to listen what i have to say, fuck.

So then I dropped out and got my GED. Started attending the local community college. And that’s what I’ve been doing for the past two years. Passing some classes but failing others. I took a final for an important class just two hours ago, and I’m waiting for the professor to email me, to tell me if I passed or failed. I could have done so much better in this class.

3) I invited an old homeless woman to stay in one of the other rooms here until eviction happens.

4) In that 20/20 hindsight I realize I made a series of avoidable mistakes that ultimately ruined my career, cost me my parental rights, and sent me straight down the path to homelessness from upper middle class.

5) Im squatting in what USED to be my apartment with no power for the last few weeks. The lease ended last month.

6) I have trouble formulating any solid plan to get back on my feet. I have no job and working as a contractor isn't paying off as well as I'd hoped..

7) I have no friends or family left to turn to for help and i dont give half a fuck about it.

8) a strange man offered me a ride home just now. I took it... he picked me up on the side of the street and then tried soliciting sex from me..

9) last night i let a half way house talk me into getting in a van at 11pm. When I got there, they asked me to piss in a cup between some bushes by the fence. Some one stole what little food I had left. They made me sleep in the common room on a couch by two other people. Then a fight broke out between the other couch dwelling residents. They refused to bring me back to my old house by saying they'd drive me and not actually going anywhere for 5 hours straight. So I walked home with what I could carry.

707,"Growing up Mormon with undiagnosed bipolar (TW: Religion, psychosis) TW: Frank discussion of childhood psychotic break. Religion. Satan. 

Originally posted this on /r/exmormon, but felt it belongs here as well. 

--------------------

I was recently diagnosed with bipolar type 2. It really shouldn't be that much of a surprise, considering my sister is also BP2, my dad is on the autism spectrum and has depression, and half of my family has behavioral issues of some kind, but it still bombshelled me. Thankfully, I've come through the worst of the initial shock, and I've started putting my sense of self back together. This has, of course, spurred me to reflect on some traumatic incidents in my childhood, and I wanted to explore them below.

Growing up, around the time I turned 12, I became a Mormon zealot. I was homeschooled, in the middle of the rural woods, in the deep south, and very fucking Mormon. I earned my Duty to God award, I studied the scriptures every single day, I journaled, I read the conference reports, I went to church, I cried for Jesus getting crucified, I had all the right answers in Sunday school... I tried to do every single thing that I was told to do. And this is where my mental illness really started to show, though I had no way of knowing it at the time.

I started having sex dreams involving other men. I couldn't rationalize this, being gay, with my ultra-radical faith, and in studying the teachings of Joseph Smith, I came to the conclusion that I was giving Satan power over me and he was making me physically attracted to other men. I began experiencing delusions that I was being attacked by devils or abandoned by the Holy Ghost, that God was angry at me for masturbating, or that false angels were appearing to me and telling me my calling and election was made sure. I truly feel that during this time I spiraled into a manic state, and I lost touch with reality.

Then the depression. Feelings of absolute worthlessness, of overwhelming guilt over being so fucking horrible and sinful to cause Jesus so much pain, that I couldn't stop sinning and that because of that I must be in Satan's control... The thoughts that Satan might actually make me harm a family member. The alarm and anxiety that led me to isolate myself for hours at a time. The agitation, the constant praying, constant reading my scriptures, trying to ""always have His Spirit"" to be with me.

One of the worst experiences I had is when we went up to a major airport. I got it in my head that the Holy Ghost left me (because you can FEEL when the HG leaves, amirite?) because of a bad thought I had, and that ""God was turning me over to Satan"". I began to panic. My anxiety kept rising. And I felt like I was literally in hell, under attack. My vision was partially blacked out, I dissociated partially, I couldn't sit still, I was agitated, absolutely distraught over losing the HG. Because that's what a loving god would do. /mindfuck

At the root of everything that, I feel, really made things worse though were two things: Gordon B. Hinkley saying that ""we can be perfect in our thoughts and our prayers"", if not our actions, which led me to set my zealot self up for failure, and in conjunction with that, a fucking OBSESSION in the leadership and youth magazines with ""bad thoughts."" I still remember that talk ""your mind is like a stage! Disinvite bad thoughts!"" Oh if only it were that simple. You mean that your brain is a complex biological organism that is completely capable of fucking with your perception of reality due to hormones, genetics, and environmental influences? YOU DON'T SAY. JUST SING A FUCKING HYMN, AND BYE-BYE SATAN.

These two toxic elements set the stage (see what I did there?) for mental instability and feelings of abject failure to cope or manage when I ""sinned"", and played off my predisposition to this mental illness. I had no idea that was happening, and truthfully, I should have been hospitalized as a kid. I wasn't.

Eventually I stopped believing in the existence of Satan, long before I gave up God or Jesus, for the sake of my own sanity. I could not believe in Satan without paralyzing anxiety and that's what I had to do to manage it. Eventually I lost God and Jesus too, and I've been out of the Morgue for seven years now (wow!), but I wanted to share my mindfuck of a childhood and how it was tainted by the Morgue.

I thought I had so much because I grew up Mormon. I thought I was gaining so much more than anyone else ever had. But it really set me back in so many ways, many of which I've come back from thankfully, but the scars it left are still clearly visible.

Thinking back on it now, the only thing worse than having breaks from reality and delusions as a kid was being taught my entire life growing up that they are normal and I should expect them. No problems here, just temptations from Satan. Go raise your arm to to the square and command him to be silent during Wednesday night activities, the priesthood gives you that power. Oh, didn't work? Well you must not be worthy.

39,"Medication So I've been on and off several types of medication the past few years. Currently I'm taking 50mg hydroxizine when anxious and geodon (ziprasidone) at 60mg. I really don't like the geodon mostly because it makes me really anxious. I have a hard time sleeping and I get frequent headaches. I've tried abilify before but it made me dizzy. Like super dizzy. I was on lamotrigene for a bit as well. I liked that one the most. It was easier on me physically and I didn't think too fast and hard all the time. But I was allergic to it and ended up with a major full body rash that took 3 weeks to get rid of. I feel like this is a losing battle. When I'm off my meds I blackout and do dangerous things, or I spend all of my money and kill my credit. I'd love not to be that way which is why I'm trying medication but nothing seems to be working.

My sheets are usually cleaner than my bedroom, although that isn’t saying much. When I’m fully awake I remember about everything I’ve done wrong, everything that’s exhausting and awful about my life, and how I want desperately to die, and that’s pretty much it. That’s what I do with my day. Sometimes I’ll go to class, or write an essay, but those are really just things I do with my hands while I think about how much I want to kill myself. 

What happened here? What did I fuck up so badly? I’m always bored, no matter what happens. I fail at everything, except things that don’t matter. I have friends, but I don’t remember the last time any of them asked me if I wanted to hang out, and they’re busy when I ask. I feel alone. I’m losing weight. I feel tired.

2096,"I am emotionally cheating on my boyfriend but it feels kind of great This was removed from the confession sub and now I feel like shit for breaking the rules :(


**TL;DR:** Am possibly emotionally cheating on bf, I don't want to, but it feels really good to remember what it's like to have someone actually being nice and supporting me and even reminding me how a person SHOULD JUST be treated. Don't wanna cheat, b/c, I love my bf but idk if it's fair to keep talking to this other guy even as just a friend with clear boundaries and I don't wanna send him the wrong message and I definitely don't want it to turn into me wanting sex w/ him.


I have been with my bf for 5 years now but he's not able to support me emotionally. It's a catch22 where he gets mad if I don't tell him why I'm upset but he gets mad when I do b/c he thinks my problems are either frustrating, stupid, or selfish. The thing is I WANT to trust *HIM* which is what makes this so hard.

Long story short there's this guy from school (I'm post-grad) I've been talking to a lot, and he's so nice to me and he listens without getting mad or frustrated or annoyed. It started out as just a friendship because he noticed I was sad one day and I kind of broke down and lost it and told him everything and it felt GREAT. It was so nice to talk to someone, and for some reason it was nice that it was a guy. It was nice to let everything out and have a guy being nice to me and supporting me and saying encouraging things, instead of getting mad at me or telling me how it's my fault or how I'm so self centered.


Problem is something **always** happens in my life. I dealt with sexual harassment at school and work and it probably fucked me up to always deal with that and I think I'm still recovering from that from years ago and thinking about all the power issues and how my body was objectified and taken from me in a way b/c guys felt like it was okay to stare or sneak pictures or even make comments about MY body. It doesn't really happen anymore thank god. To top it off, my grandfather has been doing cancer treatment and it's really affecting me. My parents are having to take care of him and they get stressed out and call me which upsets me to hear them like that. PLUS I have anxiety and depression probably from the sexual harassment b/c that shit really fucks you up. I know that's a lot to deal with, who the fuck wants that.

I love my bf but I want someone to be there for me emotionally. And he doesn't even like sex with me. He always gives an excuse to not have sex, he always tells me he just doesn't like it, but then he goes and watches porn for girls who look NOTHING like me so obviously he does have urges, but it makes me feel worthless b/c even when I try to be sexy for him he just *laughs*. And the **WORST** part is when he rejects me for sex and then gets mad because he is rejecting me for sex and he feels bad about it. So then I have to deal w/ rejection **AND** also deal w/ him being mad at me b/c I put him in that position which DOUBLE sucks. I'm worried that sort of thing is pushing me away from him and I don't want the emotional cheating to turn into anything else, in fact I want it to stop.


I'm conflicted b/c I love him, but I also love this kind of support I'm getting from my guy friend which my bf just can't give me. I didn't remember what it was like to feel listened to and supported and loved, and honestly my guy friend is all around great. He tells me I'm worth it, he tells me I'm pretty when I say I feel ugly, he tells me he understands sometimes I just want a friend. My bf never compliments me or reminds me he still thinks I'm pretty, he's not really reassuring, I feel like I'm walking on thin ice w/ him, he always tells me the things he doesn't like about me, and for him being supportive and a good bf means not saying mean things to me or things that will hurt my feelings. That's bare minimum bottom line, right? He buys me things and we hang out and go out to dinner and stuff but its so hard to rely on him when I feel down and instead I feel like I always have to hide it and it just makes me feel stressed out.


Thank god I have my therapist or else I would probably be insane but having my guy friend has really reminded me of what I USED to love about my bf. He used to me nice and supportive and romantic and that's all gone and honestly our history and past plays a role there but he says he still loves me and he keeps telling me how he's trying and putting in effort but like I said I don't think NOT being mean to me should be enough and I don't want him to think that buying me a bunch of stuff makes up for just not being nice and supportive and loving, so I even hate when he buys me stuff.


I don't want him to know I'm emotionally cheating on him and I want to stop and just go to my therapist but my therapist doesn't give me the same kind of affection that my guy friend gives me, but I don't wanna cut it off w/ him either b/c he reminded me of how a person should be treated with love and he reminded me how it felt to have that kind of friend and relationship. For once in a long time I don't feel worthless, I feel like a good person, I even feel more confident and desirable. My bf doens't even know this guy exists, but the support he gives me is everything I want. I want my bf to give me that b/c if he did I wouldn't feel this way. At the same time I feel like the biggest pile of shit b/c I'm doing this, so it's a catch22 b/c talking to this guy makes me feel GREAT but also really shitty.


My bf can never find out b/c he would be so hurt and I don't want him hurt I just want his affection, but in the absence of that it felt so easy to talk to someone else. I hate that I'm doing it.",off_my_chest,ID27430_off_my_chest,"

4383,"I get depressed by what I don’t have, then when I have it I move onto something else and it makes me even worse.. it’s a horrible circle I can’t remember the last time I was genuinely happy as an adult for more than say a few days or maybe a week at most.

However sitting down and talking to a therapist about it we discovered what I don’t have makes me depressed but doesn’t make me happy.

When I was 18 I was told to get a job, I was depressed with no job, so I finally found one that paid minimum wage and it did not make me happy instead I was depressed I didn’t make good money.

I then found a job that paid more, again it didn’t make me happy and this time I became depressed from not owning a car.

With that money I bought a car, it didn’t change  anything and then my sadness came from not being fit enough, I now go to the gym all the time and now it has moved onto not being in a relationship.

Once I’m in a relationship something else will be my next cause of sadness and just thinking about it right now is killing me, I literally go to work, go to the gym, go home and put in music until I fall asleep and wake up, then do it all over again as it’s the only comfort I know and just for that period of time I’m somewhat comfortable.

I’m sure I’ll never be happy or content with life or myself and don’t know how much longer I can handle the crushing weight I carry on myself.

I'm 13 years old. I'm a trans girl and I hate myself and want to die. I've tried to kill myself 4 or so times. I've always failed. Twice with a knife and twice by dehydration.

But the happiness is always temporary. Either for the time I'm doing it or less than 5 minutes after the experience. These things include video-games, music, drawing and a couple of other things. I use these as a form of escapism. The distract me from things I don't want to think about. This year was the first time I have loved someone that wasn't unconditional. I found out that they're too immature to handle a situation properly and that ended in a break up. One sided. I love them too much. They are moving away in January. I don't feel like I could love anyone else. But I need someone as a friend. At least for the rest of my life. I've never had a proper friend.

It's driving me crazy.

He also DOESN'T FUCKING LISTEN TO ME

I told him the dishwasher was full of CLEAN dishes, but that I would put them away and then load the dirty ones in the sink into it and run it.

Not 30 minutes later, I walk out to a running dishwasher. I asked if he unloaded the clean dishes first, and he said ""no, I noticed it was full so I ran it""

He also keeps coming home in the middle of the day and interrupting me - I work from home and this is seriously interfering with my productivity.

Every morning, he wakes up, turns the bedside lamp on, and then leaves the room to get ready for work. Meanwhile, I'm still trying to sleep since I don't have to commute, yet the light is on.

It's easier to clean socks than our floors!!!!!!

7,"2017 was the worst year of my life A little bit about me first. I am a 17 year old male. I think that is all you need to know.

Last year in 2016 when school started, I decided that I was going to change my life. I was a loser at high school before. I was involved with no sports and was hardly in any club. My grades were good but not outstanding. I used to have a solid group of friends, but they all started smoking weed so I stopped hanging out with them. My life felt worthless. I had no accomplishments. 

So when my junior year started, I changed my lifestyle drastically. I started waking up at five o'clock every morning to go on a run. At first, I started simple with just 3 miles a day. At my peak training, I was running seven miles every day before I went to school. I trained for a half marathon and ran it 1:31 (around a 6:59 min/mile pace) in April. I also started eating really healthy. I completely gave up snacks and desserts and basically ate the same thing every day.

At the same time, I became really devoted to my work at school. I was taking a rigorous schedule but was able to manage my time so well that I completed most of my work within two hours every day. For the remainder of my day, I would always do productive things: practicing for math competitions, programming, or reading. I was able to manage my time so easily because I would schedule my day in 15-minute increments. 

Basically, every minute of every day was pre-planned. I would run at the same exact time every morning, I would eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the same exact time every day, and I specifically planned how I would spend my free time. I would limit my screen time to only a 10-minute youtube video before I went to bed. 

I loved my life. I felt completely in control and was accomplishing so many goals, but then my parents ruined it. I can't blame them though. I lost 30 pounds in 3 months due to my intense eating and exercise patterns (I was at the unhealthy weight of 110lbs for a 5' 11'' male). There were also worried about my stress levels, even though I felt fine.

The tipping point occurred on December 31st, 2016, New Year's Eve. My parents wanted me to go to a party with all my old friends who used to smoke pot. I refused because I didn't want to stay up until midnight. But my parents do this thing where they try to force me to go to something by not mentioning it until 15 minutes before the event. When my mom tried to use that trick, I broke out crying. I tried to explain to her how uncomfortable I feel when I stay up past my self-assigned bedtime of 9:00 pm. She kept on thinking that I was having some sort of social anxiety issue, but she did not understand that I did not feel functional if I break my rule of going to bed at 9:00 every night.

I told my mom I needed to see a therapist. Sometime in January, I met with someone who specialized in OCD, because my mom assumed that my strict way of life was associated with the disorder. Low and behold, the therapist diagnosed me with OCD within an hour. It's hard for me to tell whether I actually had the disorder or if it just happened that I was with a therapist who specialized in OCD, so they are able to see OCD in everyone. 

In February, I saw a psychiatrist. She prescribed Prozac to treat my OCD. The problem was, I did not want to be treated. I was perfectly happy living with OCD, if I really had it. However, I was too shy to stand up for myself at the meeting. When I got in the car, I broke out crying to my mom that I did not want to change and that I did not want to go on medication. She basically scolded me that my way of life was not sustainable and that I have no choice. The next day, she forced me to take the medication.

Luckily, the medication had little to no effect. However, my rules were getting more strict. I was able to gain back my weight through counseling, but I started having more OCD tendencies. For instance, I always had to wash the dishes whenever I passed the dishwasher, I had to do 10 pushups and 10 situps every 15 minutes, and I had to measure my food before I ate it. Also, I started having panic attacks when I broke my rules such as eating the same thing every day and going to bed at 9:00. In order to stop these attacks from coming, I would occasionally take a razor blade and rub it against my arm until I started to bleed. 

I was still enjoying my life, but my parents hated it. My strict rules were getting in their way. So psychiatrist prescribed Abilify and Lexapro. Unlike Prozac, these medications actually worked. By September of 2017, all my rules went away. I could eat whatever I wanted, go to bed at what time I pleased, and spend my free time doing things that were actually fun for me. For the first week on these medications, I was so relieved.

But after the first week, things started to change. I became a procrastinator. I stopped running. I felt like my life was falling apart and becoming more like it was before my junior year. I felt like a nobody. I started becoming super critical of myself and looking back at it, very depressed.

Throughout my whole senior year, I was struggling to keep up with school work. Both my parents went to California for two weeks because my dad was having medical issues. I took the opportunity to stop taking my meds. When my parents came back, they found out and were pissed. Nevertheless, they supported me because I think they realized I was not happy on the meds. 

Unfourtanety, I felt the same off the meds as I did on the meds. One day, I was feeling particularly crappy. I did poorly in a math competition that I usually excel at and there were many assignments due soon that I had not even started. I drove to the library with an intent on working on them, but instead just stayed in my car for 1 hour. I was having pretty intense suicidal thoughts for the week prior to this day, as I felt hopeless that I was off my meds and not getting any better. That day, I decided I was going to act on them. I drove to a water tower that is by my house. I walked up to the base, planning to jump off, but I could not do it. 

I stood at the base for two hours. I couldn't get myself to scale the water tower as I was scared of facing death. At the same time, I couldn't leave as I was scared of having to go back to regular life. I was tired and I needed something to get myself to move. So I texted one of my best friends and asked him if he could help me with something. I tried to tell him what I was going through, but I could not put it in words. I texted him back ""nevermind"".

I was seriously considering doing it, but at the last minute my parents called me and asked if I wanted to go out to dinner. I took them up on their offer. But for the rest of the day, I planned on waking up and killing myself first thing in the morning. I even wrote a suicide note that night.

I woke up the next morning and could not get myself to do it. I didn't go to school. I told my parents I needed to talk to my psychiatrist. In afternoon, my psychiatrist called me and I told her I was having suicidal thoughts. She told me to go to the emergency room. 

From the emergency room, I was transferred to a psych ward which I spent 9 days in. Currently, I am missing school to attend an outpatient program. 

I am completing hopeless at the moment. I am so depressed that I spend the majority of my days just lying in bed with nothing to do. I can't get myself to do any school work. I don't even see the value in my accomplishments anymore. Because I was in the psych ward during my winter break, I could not apply to any of the colleges I wanted to. 

Anyways, 2017 sucked and I have no hope for 2018 either. My heart goes out to anyone who feels the same way. ",off_my_chest,ID12105_off_my_chest,"

She showed alot of the signs in the past few days/weeks (cutting people out, telling me she didn't know how to get over it, getting off of social media) and while I didn't think she'd hurt herself tonight I didn't want to risk it, I know she's tried to before. She told me not to come over and I was going to let her have her space but then she texted she wanted to cut everything out  and then she stopped responding to me for an hour of me asking her to just tell me she was ok. I told her I would come over if she didn't respond but now I feel like an idiot who overeacted. 
 
 I've never been close to someone this depressed and this ready to cut people out of their life so I just wanted to overeacted rather than an underreact. It honestly freaked me out because I didn't want to be one of those people who thought she wouldn't do it and then it happens. 

Now, though, I'm just sitting downstairs from her in her house feeling like an idiot and she's mad at me.

I don't know what to do, I honestly feel like I have no clue what I'm doing and I don't want to lose the is friendship and I most definitely don't want to distance her and then her really be alone and the worst happens. 

Any advice is welcome, thanks guys. 

UPDATE: She seems more relaxed now. I was just sitting downstairs in her house finishing a remote work shift (only way she let me inside) and I was planning on leaving but she subtly (not outright) asked me to stay and finish an assignment that I had told her about as it would ""make her feel better.""

My parents are good people with good intentions. But to put it bluntly, they don't believe depression exists, they think that the people who are ""depressed"" are attention-seekers who need to stay overnight in an ""asylum"" to realize how sick they aren't.

I know I'm only a year and a half (hopefully) close to graduating, and once I finally apply and get a real job, I have the potential to finally get help. Despite this, I have this idea that I'm only one step away from screwing it all up. 

I have supportive friends, who are very open about their feelings and experiences. But, every time I open up to them, I feel like I'm just word vomiting. I'm worried that by clumsily shoving my personal baggage onto them is making them extremely uncomfortable and sometimes I wonder if they are slowly trying to fade me out of their lives.

My boyfriend, who has always been my voice of reason when it comes to these subjects, always supports me. He reminds me that the things I worry about are so far ahead and very trivial (based on the situation), and to take life  one day at a time. I feel like I rely on him so much, and even though he reassures me that it's okay, I keep thinking that one day he's going to have enough with my attitude.

I know that the people who matter love me, and I should be grateful for that.

498,"I am sad today I don't talk that much to anyone, it's been a month since my last proper conversation. This week and the last I have done nothing but sit in silence, and I know it makes the others awkward so I try to stay away from them. Today one of them asked if I hated her because I don't speak anymore, I felt very sad she felt like that and I have asked for forgiveness before and she said it was alright. I'm just ruining everything.

They try to talk to me. I can't even bear looking them in their eyes, I try but at best I can swing by and glance but it fails again. I think I am making them awkward and hurting their feelings. I try to stay away but often fail to do so, and again this makes me sad due to my inability to say anything. I said I couldn't talk because I had nothing to say, but they tried to point out that talking has nothing to do with anything, I felt worthless that I could not. 

But again I did not blame anyone but myself, and I could do nothing but stand very shameful in silence. I had nothing to say, but all I wanted to say was that I was sorry. But I could not, because that would make them more awkward. But I was realy sad, angry and anxious knowing what I do and what they say to me. Either way they (probably out of pitty and because they always do invite everyone) invited me to a party, I felt like collapsing. I was quite paniced and they knew I would likely not come and that what I said was a lie. I went home, collapsed and cried for half an hour. I got a text asking if I would come, I said I was ill from the food we ate. I do feel ill from what I ate, but I think it is because of other reasons and maybe from something I ate earlier today.

-----

I read some posts, they too made me very anxious. And it has been about an hour. I have been thinking of suicide for a couple weeks now, since my depression is returning. Last week I had quite some intents but did not follow up, today it was even worse.

I don't know.

What I plan to do is get drunk, send a message to if I can call her friend and say that I am sorry for the way I am behaving. I really am sorry but I can't do anything about it and I can see it makes her sad or distressed. She will probably say it is fine but it isn't, I've ruined everything. I might go and get some more food elsewhere and hope I do not get sick.

In my mind I have been depressed for about 7 years. But it hasn't always been shit, but everytime it is good I lower my guard and get hurt or something happens. I know I shouldn't socialize because of my grose inability to do so, and yet I surround myself with people just because of who I am. I am sorry they have to be with me, that they worry and that I hurt them. That is probably the worst feeling and an initiative for me to want to end it. But I never do because suffering is worse than the unknown death, and no that is not good, but it makes others ""happy"" (at least for some time until I just break down and start pushing them away, and I guess they become happy again when we just stop talking).

Ok, I'm sorry you have to read this too. I just need to write something. Something to vent my anxiety.",suicide_watch,ID243_suicide_watch,"

It feels like every moment the feelings abate are really only a brief reprieve, the returning torment tears into my psyche with even less remourse. The corruption grows ever inside me, sometimes sleeping only to awake at times it needs to destroy.

The point of trauma feels so far away in time, nearly four years. When the episodes occur, it only feels as it happened just seconds prior. I have no physical ailments, only desolation of the mind. I haven't found an environment for healing, and I don't think I ever will. Isolation is sporadically maddening, not knowing if I'm truly losing my sanity or just feeling the pangs of past wrongdoings. Social circumstances are not helpful to the source of pain, when the episodes occur, all others can sense the turmoil and recoil at the possibility of backlash from this force.

It is a malevolent manifestation of my reality. All manner of action: speech, observation, hearing, all the surroundings are contorted to keep me bound to its dark will. None can even attempt to wrest control of the power it wields, its strength is insurmountable. I'm but a prisoner to its will, the slightest misstep in my path through life it sees an opportunity to grow and infest more within the spirit.

I feel as undeserving to face a plight so dire. It only exists when it feels the possibility to arise. I feel as though an instrument or vessel of its ill conceit. I look into a mirror to see a fair face staring back, crystal blue eyes, a symmetry  throughout; many smiles from others abound me in my days, and I feel yet obligated to receive this blessing. My looks yet deceive my emotion, for I know a disgusted figure is writhing within. I cannot tell what yet be unattractive to most: a physical flaw or a scarring of the soul that only seeks to rend into another. I won't let my fellow man that deserve peace be upended in their stable life by a force so reckless.

So I reserve myself, keeping this force of trauma at bay from others, while enduring the suffering of its imprisonment. If love could break its chains that bind itself to me and I to it; it has not yet been gifted from those that radiate beauty throughout, or even a divine power to ease my pain. Society has disillusioned me of the agony I face. I am aware of flaws of the human nature that are best left ignored. Faced against this foe forces my consciousness to the dark reality.

I only wish I had an answer or remedy to this trouble, I fear that none may be found.",depression,ID15816_depression,"

832,"No motivation and I finally know why. I'm tired of people controlling my life. I'm tired of not doing what I want to do. **I'm too smart for the world to put it lightly.** No, that's not why I have no motivation, it's why I wont be able to mask it with any of your ""suggestions."" No offense to those who find happiness or the ability to mask everything with one thing or another and just pull through life, but I'm not a sucker. I am well aware that **nobody** lives life for themselves, and that, I cannot deal with. You/We all live life for some one else, multiple other people to be exact. Unless you're every move is for some one else, you're not truly a citizen of society, and this, I do not want to deal with. I'm only 16 years old but I'm not some angsty
little bastard who'll get over it. That's just code word for, once again, no offense, getting dumber and more gullible for whatever
the reason may be. I simply don't want to live life for others, that's why I always calmly and rationally contemplate suicide. Ever since my childhood, I've been living my life for my parents. I go to school because of my parents. I do nothing else but small, quickly-passing things of pleasure like playing video games for myself. But that's it. And that's all there's ever going to be, because in the **honest** words of my parents, it's only going to get harder. Everyone here on r/depression loves to say ""it gets better"", but no, you just get more gullible and brainwashed, but I don't see that happening to me. It all starts with school. School is not
purposed to give you knowledge, it's purposed to make sure
you're ingrained and beaten down enough for what's to come
in adulthood. For the past 2, almost 3 years, I've been routinely
failing school because I don't do my schoolwork. Why? I don't want to. I don't want to and thus I don't have any motivation. So you know what they're doing to me for not having motivation for
something I don't care about? They're going to make me sit in
court and likely punish me. Yes, that smells of a desire to give
knowledge to others. In reality, they're pissed off that I'm not
conforming to society and being a good little brainwashed bi-
product and doing what they want me to do. Many of you will
say, ""But you can actually learn crucial stuff from school"", well
**I don't care to learn that stuff. I don't care to do anything to ""further myself in the eyes of everyone else."" I don't care to do
anything ""worth while,""** but there's no option in society to do
that. **So I'd rather just kill myself.** But guess what? There's
no true option for that either, so if I wanted to do that, I'd have
to not tell anyone and depending on my method of suicide, leave
my corpse to rot somewhere, likely in a huge mess, only for some one to find in horror, instead of being euthanized by professionals and immediately buried. And guess why? **Because society discourages suicide.** It **always gets better**(Aka: You'll get gullible and stupid with happiness and content for what others want of you if you really try). And before you say, ""Think of your loved ones"", my friends are just going to have to deal with it, if they are really my friends they wouldn't want me to suffer, and if thinking about what my parents have wanted for me for all of my life up until now wasn't enough, they brought me into this world against my will and now expect me to do everything they want like I'm their little robot that they built, so fuck that. This was more of a rant than anything looking for sympathy or answers, because I already have my answers, just putting this here for people who might feel the same but don't know exactly why. Not encouraging suicide but certainly am for myself, your life is yours and it's your choice to do with it what you will.",depression,ID8008_depression,"

5099,"I have lost all hope in this cruel world. First post here... 
20yo junior year engineering student. I thought I would love my major, but I absolutely fucking hate my major. My depression has gone through the roof since I left my faith, and no I can't talk to family about leaving my faith since they would not take that well at all. My only ray of happiness was the one person I ever loved, but it was totally one sided. I remember I got so happy when she messaged me two weeks ago just to say hi, I had never been so happy in what seems for a very long time now. But the very next day she abruptly blocked me on all social media for no reason at all. I have been devastated since then. 
I am sick of my crazily religious family, in my former faith it is a sin to even have a girlfriend, and just tonight I heard about a cousin who is a few years younger than me and has a girlfriend. His parents found out and they've locked him in his room with no food, nothing for the past day. I hate this disgusting world so much where people are willing to hurt their own children just to keep in line with some 7th century mythology. This whole situation has totally pushed me over the edge tonight and I can't take this anymore. 
I used to be quite a good student in high school but since my depression hit me this semester I've been doing worse than I thought possible. If I talk to my family I risk them disowning me for leaving the faith. A lot of my friends have deserted me too just because I left religion. There is only one person who makes me happy but even she won't talk to me anymore for god knows what reason. My family would want nothing to do with me after what I've done anyway, so I'd rather just end it and make my suffering go away. I am in so much pain its unbelievable. I am only alive because I have 2 great friends who are extremely supportive and it seemed like they understood what I was going through, but nowadays even they are getting tired of my sad and depressed behavior. I feel totally alone and hopeless, and it feels like no one would be sad if I go away from their lives. ",suicide_watch,ID38022_suicide_watch,"

2138,"I love you, but your insecurities are killing me. (An open letter) We found each other, when we were each residing in our darkest of places.  You said to me ""I'm the worst version of myself, at the worst time, in the worst situation.  I can't impress anyone"" the first night we were getting to know each other.  You were wrong, I was **completely** blown away - beyond impressed by who and what you are.

You have crippling depression, chronic physical pain that makes every attempt at ruining your life, BPD, ADHD, PTSD, agoraphobia, cripppling anxiety, guilt issues, and daddy issues.  I love you regardless, and accept every part of you.

I have crippling depression, am bipolar, and have PTSD topped with some mild narcissistic tendencies, and vintage daddy issues.  You accept all of that anyway, and the two shipwrecks that we found each other as, we decided we can help each other rescue ourselves.  That we would compile resources, compare notes, and find a way to sail out of this abyss - together.

It was a very, very happy couple of months for us, though I was having an easier time accepting happy than you were.  You began to try to warn me away from you:

&gt; ""I am not good for anyone, I'm especially not good for you.  I am a broken and drowning person, and if you stay, I'll take you with me.  I can't risk inflicting myself on anyone as worthy as you.""

&gt; ""I'm afraid I've somehow led you on with false advertisement.  False hope.  Hope of recovery, that I could eventually contribute, help build shelther, or forage nuts and berries, do ANYthing besides allow you to carry us both.""

I assured you that I had read all warning labels clearly, that while you aren't in a ""brief period of depression"" that all things end, eventually.  That recovery isn't a destination, but a journey, and a journey that I'm very content to make together, hand-in-hand.

&gt; ""I'm tired of burdening you, of watching your load get heavier because of me, when **my** load doesn't even get lighter by sharing.  It gets heavier because I know I'm placing them on YOU.""

But we talked about the importance of sharing burdens with each other, or sharing with others.  We were both going to therapy, together, and were both still going to therapy on our own.  We continued to improve, we kept walking, even if we were both afraid of that next step, we walked anyway.

I love you, wholly, and completely and while I've never said it to you, you seem to have a knack for knowing.  

I love that it takes an adorable hour and a half to get you out of the house, your agoraphobia manifests in the cutest way possible.

I love that sometimes when I come over, we don't speak for an hour or two.  We hug, share a chaste kiss, and  just lay with each other while YT plays with a mind of its own.  

I love cooking for you, I love that you'll actually eat when I do, when you'll go a day or two without eating if I'm not there to remind you.

I love taking care of you, keeping your appointments for you, reminding you to take your meds, or that we have an appointment in 6 hours and we should try to sleep.

I love that we'll sometimes hold hours-long conversations strictly in metaphors, because standard language doesn't always do justice to what we're feeling and experiencing.

I love that you refuse to plan for the future, because that fact alone means we live entirely in the moment.

I love the way you look at me when you're having a complete and total meltdown, and I grab your hands, and tell you it's going to be okay.  That I'm here, and you're here, that we both exist, and as long as that holds true, we're going to make it.

I love that you're always willing to assess your state, that even when you're feeling suicidal, you'll tell me about it, we'll talk about it.

I love that after 10 years of self-destructive behavior, abusive relationships, and willingly allowing ourselves to be manipulated, we have found each other.

But last night, I laid in your lap and you ran your hand through my hair, to the sounds of Cryaotic playing games on YT, and that exchange shook my world.  I told you, with sincerity, how grateful I was to have found you, and to have you in my life.  I was expecting your pained smile.  Knowing the words made you happy, but that down inside, you were still going to think you don't deserve me.  You didn't smile though, something twisted inside you, and I could literally see your demons stirring inside while you formulated these words:

""You're going to love me.... soon.  Aren't you?""

""*::smiles::* I suppose that it's pretty likely, yes.""

""Well, I'm going to disappoint you... soon.""

I do, love you.  And I'll tell you, soon.  But it's going to make you redouble your efforts to push me away.  We've discussed your habit for self-sabotage (and mine for that matter), and your tendency to push away the people that mean most to you.  How you're afraid to be vulnerable, and afraid to ""inflict yourself"" on anyone ""good.""

Well, I'm not ""good.""  I'm good for you, and you're good for me.  But I'm starting to get tired of having to work twice as hard every time you try to push me away.  And you try, a lot.

I know I've made you happy, made you smile, and made you laugh, even when it was the last thing you wanted to do.  And you've done the same for me.  You constantly ""compare"" what I've done for you, against what you've done for me.  But what you fail to recognize is that most of what you've done for me is invisible to you, but I see it clear as day.

You have made me a stronger person, a better person, and a healthier person.  Because I live my life for two, now, for both of us.  Sometimes I despair, and I don't want to be strong, I don't want to be healthy for myself.  But I keep moving now, because I have to be strong for YOU, healthy for YOU.  And it's incredible to have more than just me, as a reason to continue.  

You are the reason I continue to better myself.  You're the reason I chased that promotion, got my raise, tried to better position myself to take of myself, and you.  You are the reason I'm still here, still breathing, because I was pretty damned suicidal when I met you.

I love you, and everything about you, but your insecurities are killing me.  You are the most beautiful person I've ever known, both inside and out - but it's inside that matters.  You've lived such a painful life devoid of joy for so long.  I just want to provide that joy to you for more than a day or two, before you shut down and isolate yourself from me for a day or two, spending your days crying and telling yourself you don't deserve me, and that you're going to hurt me.

I'm not afraid of hurt.  We don't get to choose whether or not we get hurt in this life, it happens to all of us.  We get to choose **who** has the opportunity to hurt us: and I choose you, Pikachu.  &lt;3

3429,"Not sure if I'm worth anything. Forgive the rambling nature of this post. I have a lot on my mind, and not a lot of organization to make this any more legible.

Recently I’ve done a lot of thinking. I’ve had a lot of opportunities to be happier in life, to be in a better place than I am right now. I’ve been to college multiple times, but I find myself so terrified of messing up, and it just makes it so that I can’t get anything done, and then I fail as a result. I hate it. I feel so unfulfilled working minimum wage, low-skill jobs, where I have to put up with the crap that other people set out for me, but I can’t bring myself to take the risk that I’d need to get anything more than that.

I feel empty, in some ways. I find happiness in my interactions with other people, in making them smile and knowing that I had an impact on someone else’s life, in some way, even if it was minimal. Yet, once that interaction stops, once I’m alone, I feel hollow. Pointless, purposeless. I need noise, just to function. The silence deafens me more than anything else, the lack of stimulation kills me more than any bullet ever could. Yet despite that, I find it near-impossible to get any satisfaction from my own imagination, my own creativity, which disgusts me.

I don’t know if I have a point in all of this that I’m saying. Maybe it’ll help just to have this out there, maybe not. I really don’t know, but that’s okay, I suppose. Thanks for reading.",off_my_chest,ID29992_off_my_chest,"

It seems like before I know it it’s 5am and time to repeat it over and over again. This has gone on for the past 7 months and has gotten progressively worse over time. 

I’m not really sure what to do. My financial situation calls for me to stay at home with my two young kids while my fiancé works so most days I’m just trapped in here staring at the same four walls. My fiancé doesn’t understand me when I tell him that everything seems dull and grey. I know I sound like a whiny, sad sack of shit but I feel like I’m legitimately on the verge of a mental breakdown. 

Is there anyone else in here who’s gone through this who is also a parent? Or just anyone who’s gone through this at all? It feels like I’ve lost my identity. I keep trying to remember things that I liked to do before I became a parent but I come up blank. I’ve even lost the ability to have normal social interactions. Like, I used to be very outgoing and pretty talkative but now it seems like when I’m at a social gathering I can’t find anything to talk about for the life of me. Then I end up just coming across really weird and desperate and socially awkward. I’m tired of everyone telling me “that’s the mom life and you just have to suck it up”. It doesn’t feel like every other mom or parent is feeling this way. I feel like I’m drowning.

And every answer I gave was a lie



You'll feel better by the way you dress


Maybe, just maybe I'm just depressed



You'll feel better if you sleep well often


Maybe I would rather lay down in a coffin



You'll feel better if only you'll try


I try and try but I still want to die



You'll feel better if you see your friends


Maybe every beginning looks like an end



You'll feel better if you hit the gym


Maybe feeling bad is simply a sin



You'll feel better if you leave it behind


Yet I'm left with nothing, chewing the rind



You'll feel better if you let it all go

Happily (as much as BPD allows) married to a wonderful man, and we have a beautiful, brilliant toddler. They're so good to/for me - I often feel undeserving. 
I've been in a depressive episode for almost 2 months - med compliant, have been for 3 years. 

Lately, I've been fucking up little, typical people things; scratched the car, got scammed out of $300, letting food go bad in the fridge... They're hitting my self-worth hard for no other reason than my low threshold for disappointment and my high expectations of myself. 

The latest thing is a creepy message left on my front door on Valentine's Day saying they saw me in the area and wanted to leave their number/Facebook in case they never saw me again.... WTF. Of course my husband is pissed, and I feel like my privacy has been 100% violated. Husband is SO upset that he has a hard time seeing how this affects me - but besides that, I feel like I'm way more trouble than I'm worth. 
My constant emotional turmoil, the fatigue, prescription drug costs, migraines that make me worthless for hours. 
I feel like I should just be alone. Like the people I love shouldn't be subjected to my bullshit and have to clean up my messes or pay my debt when I die (just got denied life insurance for BPD diagnosis). 
I have a lot of supportive people in my life, family, friends, therapist. Regardless, I can't shake this worthlessness, self-loathing guilt. 

Thanks for reading if you do, just having a rough... life right now. I know this probably sounds whiny - I have an objectively great life that I've worked hard for. Why do I still feel so shitty? ",bipolar,ID27085_bipolar,"

Long story: I've been depressed for a very long time, possibly since I was 8. I've always had behavioral problems (my father has BDP) and I got what you call ""fleas"" that is, even if I am not BDP myself, I unfortunately picked up some of his traits. Monkey see monkey do after all. 

So I've been told to stop acting like a victim and I've been called a compulsive liar. Sure, who hasn't lied in their life once in a while? But I didn't do what this person is accusing me of. 

Not too long ago, I was finally able to speak to someone who really understands where I'm coming from. It was nice to have that, just another person like me, not a councilor. Well, I can't do that anymore, I won't go into details but it won't happen. Not unless I want to prove this person's point that yes, I am a liar. So I'm left with nothing.

And I'm ok with that. A while back I was thinking about suicide again, and how doing it now wouldn't seem so scary. It's like all the fear is just gone. I've been waiting for something to push me once more, this time without a doubt, over the edge. I have no where to run. Yes, I am a shitty person. Yes, I have ""played the victim"" all these years because I don't know how to get better. Drugs don't help, therapy doesn't help. My dad who damaged me will never change because of his personality disorder. I feel that if he were to finally change I might change too.

4718,"I can’t remember the last time I was happy, any advice on how to deal with society? I’ve been hesistant to post this because I know I’d probably get shit since I don’t have the worst situation out here, but I guess l just really needed some advice now more than ever. I’m just too sick and tired of being unhappy already. I’m not sad or depressed, just unhappy for about 4/5 years now. I don’t know how else to explain it. Somehow I’m still sane despite overthinking every second of my life, I guess that’s one thing I could be proud of. I know I don’t live an impoverish life, I have all my limbs intact, I don’t do any vices so yeah call it a privileged or happy life if you want, if you’re just here to tell me to be thankful for shit instead of complaining I’d prefer you just keep it to yourself because I’ve just had about enough of that getting shoved down my throat all my life.

I honestly don’t think “unhappy” cuts it. It’s merely the simplest word I could come up right now but actually, it’s a lot of things. Miserable. Dispirited. etc. One of the reasons I’m posting this is because I haven’t actually came across someone with the same situation. It’s like a 24/7 reminder that I can’t be emotionally comfortable, like something is keeping me from true happiness. Sure I can get a good test result or a great meal every now and then, the simple joys. But at the end of the day, when it’s just you and your thoughts, I can’t help but feel unsatisfied. I start to remember all the bad memories and decisions I’ve made and although I know it isn’t healthy, my mind does it anyway.
I don’t know if it’s my problem of setting a “happy” standard too high (which I highly doubt) or something else. This is where you guys come in, I hope someone knows what I’m talking about. I’m eager for answers and constructive critisicm.

I get ridiculed and rejected almost everyday of my life by my own brother and I started getting bullied in school around 4 years ago. I have a dysfunctional family and had the harshest, most toxic set of friends. In my school, they legitimitely believed that jokes can’t be funny unless it’s personal or hits below the belt. So yeah, to them they’re just having fun so no one could call it bullying, not even me, even if I feel that way. Mistakes are remembered and if you can’t take an insult they’ll harass you all the more. Generally I get called stupid or an idiot the most, heck it’s like my identity in school. Even by my own brother. I grew up getting bullied by him because he had no where else to displace his anger from the whole separation my parents had. I have no one to talk to at home because my brother is going through some kind of rebellious phase and my parents are busy struggling to make a living, so I think that opening up to them might just add a burden. AND trust me, I’ve opened up before and sure maybe they’d just have compassion for that night, but the next time you guys argue about something, they’ll bring up your personal shit just to insult you with no remorse and no respect that what you told them came from the bottom of your heart. I hope someone can relate to this because this is one of my biggest pet peeves. I’ve tried finding other friends nearby, finding a decent counselor in school and even joining my local church. I don’t know, I just can’t find the answers I’m looking for. Deep down I honestly think I do know what to do, and maybe, just maybe wanna hear from someone else. But it’s difficult waking up everyday knowing you’re all alone and even oftenly being made fun of for being single and not having friends by my own “friends”. This is actually my biggest concern right now, after all the abuse I’ve been through one would think I would have gotten use to it by now, whenever I’m told I don’t have friends or I’m made to feel like I don’t belong, or when people take advantage of me. But I’m not used to it, not even by a little. It hurts every time someone makes that joke, thing is, I wasn’t insecure about it back then so I don’t know what went wrong. Why did my life suddenly take a bad turn? Am I too sensitive? Was it because I was raised up just to be polite and helpful to everyone I encounter? Is this what made me so weak? See it’s quite odd because my family thinks I’m the most mentally stable sibling. My friends think I’m some sort of punching bag who’ll never bite back from an insult. I simply think I’m not going to turn into one of them.

[ Since I’m starting to get conscious of my dirty laundry I can end it here.. for those willing to help, here’s a brief history of my life so far. I’m desperate to know what went wrong ]

To tell you the truth things didn’t start this bad. For a moment in highschool I was “popular” at one point cause my dad went to jail for doing something right &amp; just, and ofc, it was all over the news. I got invited into several groups and got to know the “cool kids”. I had a crush on the prettiest girl, and after courting her for months, she started to like me back, and trust me, for those have not experienced this IT WAS A BIG FUCKING DEAL. It was the best moment of my life. Now I feel so incomplete without someone or something to define me or something to be part of. Back then I had no struggles waking up in the morning because I was so excited for any messages she left, and I’d go to bed happy, despite any unfortunate events throughout that day. It kept on for 10 months. October 15th was the day we finally called quits after weeks of drama. She’d lost interest in me and trust me when I tell you, seeing the person you love the most in the world love you less day by day is one of the most painful things to ever feel. I swear I literally felt the physical pain in my heart. I had a bunch of rebounds but they all ended up just talking behind my back and tarnishing my reputation. I’d wake up and go to bed angry at everything and even randomly cry at every love song that comes on the radio. I’ll admit, during that phase I made a lot of bad decisions, and these bad decisions got me kicked out of just about every group I got close to. I started to be treated like an outcast, people started to respect me less and my weak self was becoming so insecure I oftenly spread myself to thin just for someone’s approval. There was even this one dude who wrote “No Friends” on my uniform; it was pathetic. 

It was a just downhill from then till now. I recently entered college and I was actually excited to meet new people, I was hoping for a change. But all I feel now is more awkward and out of place all the time. It’s as if everyone already knew each other from highschool, everyone already has each of their own cliques so I feel that there’s no security that opening up to one of them won’t screw me over. Everyone seems to be just after their own personal gain. Everyone just wants sex or drugs or fame. I’m starting to feel crazy since I’m the one asking questions about how fucked up society is. All I see is everybody being great at what they do, excelling at their respective sports, getting into relationships (platonically and romantically) and getting high grades. I feel like I’m missing out on life and I want to stop wasting my time. The only thing I actually love to do is gaming and I’ve spent hundreds of thousands of hours in that hobby and I’m not even a professional at any game in particular. I’ve tried other hobbies and I just don’t have any astounding talent for anything. Not to be selfish but here’s honestly what I just really want. I want to belong and play a vital role in society. I want to be invited instead of always being the inviter. I want to be respected. I want my opinion to matter to someone. I feel that I could literally disappear and no one would even show up in my funeral. 

I’m still honestly shaking to hit post. But since I’m doing this anyway I just wanna say I’m more interested in unusual advice. plsbenice ",off_my_chest,ID40316_off_my_chest,"

2351,"A list of my problems in life. 1. I have no social presence, I'm that lonely pathetic kid who everyone thinks is autistic, and I have no actual qualities considering I'm an extremely boring person, I have very few interests and every ""conversation"" with me feels like a fucking nightmare, no wonder I don't have any friends.

2. I got 32 in the AQ test so I might actually be autistic or have Asperger's. Good enough reason to pull the fucking trigger. I'd blame god but I'm an atheist so I only have myself to blame, which I've had enough of already.

3. I am clueless about my sexuality, in some days I even identify as a lesbian girl, even though I'm male, but in other days I feel completely different. In other words, I'm very unstable.

4. I heavily struggle at school, because I lack motivation to attend to my classes and do my homework, and not because the material is difficult. I don't go out with friends, because I don't have any. I just sit in my room and look at a screen for hours every day, I don't even enjoy this anymore, but nothing else brings me joy either, really. I haven't felt happy in years.

5. I have a step-douche who eats more than the minimum wage he brings from working 10 hours every day, and he gives exactly 0 fucks about my emotions or my needs because he's a fat pig that only cares about himself, so he can keep watching his fucking porn on our computer and fap his useless and disgusting 2-inch penis because my mother doesn't want him. My real father left when I was 3 years old. I wish he died and is rotting in hell right now for not pulling out in time.

6. Our ""family"" that includes me, my mom and step-douche is somewhat poor, so I have exactly 0 chances to go to college without working and saving money for at least year before that. After my 3 mandatory years of military service, of course. Going to college at 23 - living the dream. That of course if I don't fail all my finals, which is very likely to happen, and will delay any college plans by 2 more years.

7. I have a massive crush, more like obsession actually, with a fictional video game character. I've been this way for months now. She is absolutely perfect, and I understand that she doesn't exist in real life, because no one this perfect can ever be real, which makes me feel even worse, because it basically makes me feel as though there's no point in even trying.

8. I've started drinking at nights, alone, in bed. Just so I'm able to cry myself to sleep, considering otherwise I just can't sleep at all from all the things in my mind that I just can't tell anyone because there isn't anyone out there who would listen... The internet doesn't count.

My life is miserable right now and I don't see any sort of escape. I'm pretty certain that I'm depressed but I haven't talked to a professional about it, so I'm basically just some attention-hungry pathetic emo swine. I'm not suicidal, considering my beliefs regarding afterlife, so death means that everything ends and then there's just nothing, which I'm much more afraid of than living in pain.

4693,"Really uncertain - my support system is split Bipolar Disorder I, diagnosed officially about 2? years ago. I have a two person support system, my mom and my fiancé. Both have experienced the very bad and the good with me. We've been through hell and back on this journey. I'm blessed they never gave up on me. My ""before"" was a time where I wasn't on any medications. I wasn't the nicest person, I would act/think irrationally and impulsively, and would frequently explode into uncontrollable fits of rage. My mom saw a lot more of the before since it started when I was in my early teens. My fiancé has also experienced the before when we first started dating. He didn't have a long time under the before siince he's actually the reason I sought out help again in the first place (I was seeing a therapist, but not my psychiatrist anymore.) I was put on ADHD medication, and everything stopped- it was a complete 180. 

That's where the ""after"" comes in, which I've been in for about 6 years now. I am able to think/react rationally, I'm aware of my thoughts and emotions when I need to be and know how to process them in a calm and logical way. When I started having stronger, more noticeable symptoms of bipolar episodes, and became more aware of what I was experiencing, and took them to my psych and that's when I started medications for that. It's been alright, we've had to try different medications and adjusting them. Currently I'm on lamictal and Lexapro for my depressive episodes, and lithium for the manic, I don't know the dose off the top of my head since we just increased it the other day. Depressive episodes are the same symptoms every time with varying levels (mild, moderate, severe.) My manic episodes symptoms can be the same or may vary. Some times I'll experience an extra symptom - it's definitely bipolar related, it just don't happen every time, like I'm not always hyper sexual, I don't always have meltdowns, etc. With both depressive and manic episodes, I am aware of what I'm feeling. If I do something out of character, I analyse it, and determine if it's a product of an episode (almost always only during manics.)  If it's a negative action, I never excuse it - bipolar or not. I just make a note of it if it's bipolar related and try to be more aware if it or something similar to it happens again, so I know what I need to do to stop it from happening. There are never any build ups to my episodes, and if there are, it hasn't happened enough for me to be aware of it. 


Now that you're all caught up, onward we go. I got my usual phone call from my mom, we talk at least 3 times a week. During the conversation, I told her I'm coming off a manic episode that started the weekend before. She mentioned she figured I was manic, and I asked her she could tell (she actually only called me once this past week. The conversation was short, and she did most of the talking.) She told me it's been the way I've been acting lately. Ok, explain? She told me that she's worried, because I'm acting like the before. Ok, examples? First one she gave was an opinion I gave on a family friend. She said it was so mean spirited. I acknowledged how it absolutely came off that way, and didn't excuse how it came off. I can be a real cynical asshole sometimes. 

The second example she gave me? Totally disagree. It was during an event my youngest brother was participating in a little over a week ago. It was a really big deal to everyone in the family because he was taking a huge step out of his comfort zone. During the event, which was a male pageant? ( I guess you can call it that...) and when my youngest brother appeared on stage, my mom put her hand over her face and say ""oh god"" like she was embarrassed-she did this twice. She also said something else that came off as she was annoyed with him. I made comments of ""really?"" ""Seriously?"" And ""are you kidding me?"" While this were all said with a bit of annoyance in my voice, I did not yell, I didn't even say them in a normal tone of voice, I quietly said them, no one around us heard. In response to each of these (individually, not all at one time.) She responded in a very poor way (told me to cut it out or leave, told me to shut up) and I reacted by letting her know I was here to support my brother, and silently let her know I did not accept her half ass apology (no, I didn't flip her off, just slightly put my hand at upper belly height, and didn't look at her.) She did one other thing, I can't remember what, but I asked my younger brother to switch seats with me. She said in the most childish tone ""you're still going to be next to me!"" She wasn't wrong, but in my new seat I was able to be next to my dad and have a legitimate reason to ignore her, instead of my old seat where no one was next to me except her so I just had to stare forward. We didn't speak for the rest of the night, until I sent her a text explaining why I felt her behavior was unacceptable, how it came off as unsupportive of my brother, and why I reacted to it the way I did. •important to note, as far back as I can remember, my mom has NEVER acted the way she did that night. She apologized, explained her side. End of story. Until yesterday. 

I told her that I felt I reacted in a reasonable way to her behavior. There was no overreaction, no scene, nothing. She said ""you didn't see it. It was like you were a totally different person then you've been. It was like the before."" This fucking floored me. I asked her how it was like the before, she said the way I spoke to her, and the look in my eyes. She said she wished she had a camera so she could've taken a picture of my face, she was honestly a little scared. So she thought I was manic because of that night. I told her no, I wasn't manic at all, I had zero other indicators, my episode didn't start until Saturday. She said maybe it was a build up to an episode. Wrong again, I have never once, to the best of my knowledge, had a build up to an episode. Well maybe it's the lithium. Doubt it, I've been on it for a little over 2 months at that point, I think either someone or I would have noticed sooner if I was showing signs of slipping into the before. Conversation over, call ended awkwardly. After the call, I asked my fiancé, my second support person, if he felt I was showing signs that I was slipping into the before. He said, while I reacted in a way of the before over the weekend (I was in a state of high aggression, and ended up yelling at him basically all weekend) which he didn't like, but he understood it happened because I was manic, he felt that nothing else was making him concerned. 


Here's why I'm posting this - I am fucked up over this. I used to feel very in control of myself, except for episodes and a day here and there. I felt aware of my thoughts, feelings, and actions. I felt I had a grip on reality, on how to handle myself and how to act appropriately and rationally to all situations. Was it this way all the time? No, nothing is perfect. But for the most part, I felt like I somewhat had my shit together. Now? All that is right out the window. I am now a mental shit circus. Part of me believes my mom, part of me doesn't, but she's my mom, why would she tell me something this serious if it wasn't actually happening? It doesn't help at all that my support system is also split on this. I'm confused and uncertain and have no where to turn. Because I am just surrounded by uncertainty, I am questioning everything, my thoughts, my emotions, my reactions to thing, all of it. In the back of my mind I'll ask ""is this the way I thought about XYZ in the before?"" ""Did I react to this or that the way I did in the before?"" ""Am I feeling this way like I did in the before?"" ""I thought I reacted reasonably, but maybe I didn't? Let me look back and furiously overanalyze the situation and get no clear answer."" I don't know how to handle this. I don't want to be stuck in this uncertain state. 


TL;DR - bomb dropped. My mom is worried and said I should be too. Fiancé says it's all good, sees no reason to worry. Used to be confident, now I'm questioning myself and if I was really confident at all. And my support system are on opposite ends. ",bipolar,ID38622_bipolar,"

And I'll never be appreciated. I'm not sure  what keeps me from doing a 1800 splash off a bridge. But for some reason, I gotta keep going. Maybe it'll get better. But I'm not getting any younger. I'll always be the case of untapped potential, it seems. ",depression,ID39419_depression,"

774,"I should know better. That's the worst part. Don't ever say the words right out. That's how you get yourself in trouble.

That said... it comes more and more frequently now. I've been going through a divorce with the woman who I believed was my world, my everything - and to hear her tell it, I'm responsible for everything falling apart. In fairness I'll take responsibility for a good 90% of it, and I wish I'd have realized how unhappy she was before it ever got here.

A few years ago, I had to bury my daughter. Technically stillborn, but I held her in my arms and wept while there was a flatline tone going in the next room, and that helped kickstart the depression back up, as well as the PTSD. Fortunately, they didn't commit me for that, so I could still get my hands on a weapon if I wanted to. It's still up in the air whether that's a good thing - hence why I'm here.

They say the holidays are the worst, and I think that's probably true. Maybe this'll ease off in time - but I've gone to all sorts of different doctors, tried different medications, gone to therapy and groups and meetings, and none of it seems to make any difference. If anything - you know how there's that point where you're so depressed that you'd do something, but it's so bad that you don't have any initiative or energy to do it? Maybe the meds help - and then I start getting enough energy to really consider doing something, and then stop it before things go too far.

As I sit here writing this, I look at my 2 year old daughter, and I think about my 10 yr old son, both of whom keep asking me why I'm so sad. Well, my son does - my daughter just insists on sitting next to me and clinging whenever I start randomly crying out of nowhere. My ex asked me earlier in the week if I wanted to have them stay at her place this weekend, and I really, really wish they had. But then I'd be posting in /DeathNotification (if there was such a reddit, I haven't checked) so it's just as well in it's own way.

I don't want to screw up my children. I don't want to hurt my parents, my ex, my friends - anyone really. But I'm so beyond tired - and while I sit here trying to be a pillar of strength for other people I know who are having problems, that little voice in the back of my head that knows exactly what I need to do to make this all stop?

1503,"Looking for someone that can relate. Hi everyone.
Well, I am writing it to vent this off my chest. I'm a 20yoM. 
These are the main reasons that I often use to justify killing myself when I'm really hopeless:


-I'm extremely lazy, I suck at my job, and I'm excluded by my peers. No need to mention what my boss thinks of me. I can't figure how I haven't been fired yet. I also have no motivation to get a degree.

-I basically live in my workplace (I know is hard to picture it), so being excluded by my peers hits really hard on me.

-I hate my work, but I need specifically this job. It sucks having a job that doesn't fit you and you know that you don't have future in it. But, for now, I need it. Even needing it, I can't bring myself to enjoy it or to make any efforts beyond the bare minimum.

-I have no motivation at all, maybe because I have an undiagnosed depression. Plus I can't fix it because I can't go to a psychiatrist because my job doesn't allow me to (long story), even on the weekends. I do make pull-ups and push-ups almost every day if that counts as proper exercise. I have no motivation to get out of my house, at vacations. I hate vacations. 

-I have no talents.

-I have Aspergers. It sucks being socially ""braindead"". I can't stand being more than 4 hours without being alone. Meanwhile, NASA is still trying to figure out how I didn't murder any of my coworkers due to lack of ""being alone"". 

-Even though I'm still virgin because that's the least that I can do for God (Not for long, probably). I am a potential pedophile. I get turned on by seeing kids get violently spanked. I fear to be around children, because of that.

-No matter how much I try, I can't give a fuck to my family. They deserve better from me, but I can't.

-I'm a shitty son.

-I'm a shitty brother. I'm the anti-role model. 

-I laugh when people tell me misfortunes. I smiled for minutes when a fellow at work told me, crying, that he was planning to kill himself (I made sure he wasn't noticing). After that, I've purposefully avoided him. A similar event happened again months later but I can't record it.

-I am starting to hate God. (That's the worst one)
I can't bring myself to go to church anymore, and I am seeing the bad effects that this is having on me, but I don't have the motivation to go to the church confess my sins or attend the mass.

-I started smoking tobacco to replace my masturbation addiction. It didn't work. I can't get addicted to tobacco (I don't regret starting smoking btw) and I can't stop watching so much weird porn, including illegal things, sadly.  

-I can't bring myself to do most of the things on my own, except for the extremely necessary to my survival. The rest I expect to my family to eventually do for me by pity.

-I can't bring me to kill myself, even though I'm going to hell anyway. 

-I could only finish a 94 pages book in the last year. Only one book. I used to read 5 or 6 books per year in my early teens.  

-I HAVE NO TRAGIC PAST OR SHITTY CHILDHOOD. I NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH ANY THOUGH SHIT, YET SOMEHOW I MANAGED TO BECOME A DEPRESSED UNGRATEFUL LASCIVIOUS (ALMOST CRIMINAL) WORTHLESS DEATH-DESERVING BASTARD.

Well, that's what I could get off my mind. Somehow, I'm feeling a lot better after writing this.
I'm not looking for advice, yet I will accept them anyway. The most important thing for me is to know if there's someone out there that can relate in some way or another, so I can feel less hopelessness. 
Thank you for taking your time to read.

My wife warned my I was spending to much time on my phone and that I wasn't paying attention to her and I didn't listen. Why? I have no answer because I truly do not know. I loved her then as I do know. There isn't a single being on this planet that will ever love her and care about her as much I do. So why was I ignoring her? Why wasn't I listening to the signs she was giving? Now it's to late... 


She says she doesn't want us to separate and that she wants us to work out but she's emotionally done trying. She's been trying for two years to get my attention. That's all she wanted was my attention. Why would I ignore the one person I love and care about the most on this world. PLEASE SOMEONE EXPLAIN IT cause I can't understand why? I'm losing her day by day if I haven't lost her already. for once in my life I understand what the feeling is to want to go away and end it all to not feel like this anymore.

What's life without that one person that completes you? I never thought I'd feel like this unless we were old and dying. I sit at home alone trying to think of how life would go without her and nothing makes sense. I wouldn't want to be alive anymore. 

I've never regretted marrying her. I've never questioned my love for her. I've never stopped caring for her. I'd do anything for her so why did I do this to her. Why did I act like this and make her beg for my attention and then not see it when she was trying? I'm lost. I need someone to explain why? I've tried a psychiatrist but my new jobs insurance is no good till January 1st and I can't handle this anymore. Please help

1474,"I'm disappointed with everything That includes myself, by the way. I'm disappointed in myself at least as much as I am in other people, because I've consistently failed at every major goal I've set over the years. I'm 26, and I'm living on disability because of my depression. I'm a relatively healthy young man and quite often I can barely leave my room. But, I'm not here to talk about how much I dislike myself. You see, I actively dislike the world. The world that we've collectively built as human beings is horrifying to me, and I don't like the fact that I have to participate in it. And the fact that ""the world"" is financially supporting me while I say this, just adds a nice veneer of genuine hypocrisy to everything I'm saying here. But it doesn't change how I feel. I used to be able to work, but now I can't because of my anxiety and depression. But even when I was working, I genuinely hated every moment of it not just because of my anxiety, but also because I disliked everything it represented. I was contributing to a system I have little respect for. I'd go into details but I don't want to get political here. My ideology, worldview, and personality are completely antithetical to this society. I disagree with virtually everyone I know, both online AND offline, on the most fundamental things. And no, I'm not suggesting that this is because I'm ""smarter"" than anyone else, it's just that I see the world in a different way. I could be wrong about everything, who knows. But the fact is I'm completely alone because I have virtually nothing in common with the vast majority of people, aside from the facts that I breathe air and have a heartbeat. I'm a fundamentally lonely person, and I don't think it's even possible for that to change. The only person I've ever really connected with is my therapist, but I suspect that's because it's her job to connect with her clients. Oh well. It could also be that I'm just a generally unpleasant person to be around. I don't think that's the case, but it could very well be true because I'm an ""unreliable narrator,"" even to myself. It could just be that I'm a bitter man with a bitter sense of humor and a bitter disposition. I used to have high hopes generally, when I was really young. But that's all gone now. I'll never get that back, and the sense of loss I feel about that is actually pretty overwhelming. I wish I still had hope of some kind, but deep down I know that I will eventually die a sad and lonely man. I don't really know what the ""goal"" of this post is. Thinking about it, there's only one thing I really want right now and that's someone to talk to. But if no one wants to talk that's perfectly fine too. I know that talking to me is draining for people. I'm alone in the world and I wish I wasn't. There, that's my thesis. I hope reading this hasn't bored or depressed you, and I hope I haven't made myself sound like a fool.

Went from feeling really good to just wanting to fall back into the bittersweet embrace of old habits (I’m wondering if I was just in a hypomanic episode or if it was the antidepressant and it just wore off, if it was the antidepressant would I crash still?  Is the lamotrigine even doing anything*?).  It’s been three years and it still feels like day one.  I look better, but I don’t feel it.  I’m finally getting help, but I can’t see myself getting truly better.  I feel like I’m trapped, forced to pretend like I’m happy and healthy with nothing to stop me.  I feel like my struggle to become mentally healthy is a hill that I have to convince myself and others that I’ve gotten over, but it’s still there and I’m still in its shadow.

I feel lost and alone.  I know people who’ve went through similar struggles and they’re better.  They recovered so quickly and I’m still projecting onto them.  It’s just another layer to it.  I feel like shit and now I worry about them too because if I haven’t gotten over it, then in my head that means they’re stuck there too, just making me believe they’re ok.  Logically this isn’t the case, they’ve been truthful in the past, but I can’t help it.

It’s double frustrating because I gotta be up in 7 hours for a final and my lows make it impossible to sleep - my brain didn’t get the memo that I should want to sleep more when depressed and less when hypomanic, thanks brain.  I end up sleeping when I feel good because I’m so sleep deprived and can’t sleep because my brain won’t turn off about how awful everything is.

If I didn’t have this monster looming over me every chance it got I feel like it’d take off some of the intensity.  It’s frustrating and tiring and I just wish I never started.  You’d think after three years of not doing something I wouldn’t feel like I need to do it to relax or feel ok.

My lows are just getting worse and it’s so scary.

*Edit: My lack of faith in lamotrigine is because I know someone who has BPD and it doesn’t work.  Bipolar runs in my family as well (yippy), so I worry about misdiagnosis.  Putting a ton of faith in my psychiatrist though.  If it doesn’t work it doesn’t work and we’ll figure something else out.  I’m just tired of feeling like this.

706,"How I feel I feel dead inside.  4.5 years its been.  June 2013 is when it all started.  I’ll never forget reading that medical report from the radiologist.  “Possible spondylolysis of L5.”  When asked why I missed so many classes at the end of the term, I told the class “spondy-LOL-isis.”  They all laughed at me because I spelled it out and they heard, “LOL.”  They thought I was being my usual funny self.  I laughed along too.  If I had ever known how much pain and suffering was to come, I would’ve killed myself then.

Now here I am, on Christmas Day at 1am, putting into words for the first time how I feel.  Why I’m writing this I don’t know.  Maybe it’s a subconscious suicide letter.  Mom has just gone upstairs.  She had been trying to console me for the past half hour.  The last thing she said was, “remember, we love you.”  The funny thing is I never doubted that.  The love my family has for me is undeniably great.  Without them I would’ve killed myself a long time ago, which may make them seem like my saviours, but right now, it feels like im battling a foe armed with a double-edged blade.  On one edge, my family’s love protects me from financial and logistical troubles.  On the other side, their support is like a barbed medical syringe with the temporary medicine to keep me going.  They help me stay alive, but the more effort they put in, puts even more pressure on me.  How can I kill myself knowing what it would do to them?  Often, I just wish I had deadbeat parents who didn’t give a shit about me.  That way I could end my suffering knowing that it wouldn’t hurt anyone else.  

Imagine, if I killed myself.  I personally wouldn’t give a shit, but that’s because I’d be dead.  How would my baby sister feel?  The person I love more than anyone else in the world.  I can already see what I’ve done to her.  She has had to go through puberty seeing her once role-model brother mutate into an unimpressive, cowering heap of missed potential.  But throughout it all, she has handled it amazingly.  I couldn’t be more proud of who she’s become.  The loss of happiness I have endured has only seemed to galvanize her.  She  is what keeps our family glued together.  No matter what happens to me, I can rest easy knowing that she’ll become an amazing woman.  I love her so much, and this love twists the dagger even more.  Do I continue to barely scrape by in life, hating every minute of it?  The only reason I would do this would just be to delay the inevitable.  To give more time for her to mature, so that  when my flame is extinguished, she’ll be better prepared to deal with the sorrow.

I don’t know why I’m typing this right now.  Maybe its because I’ve tried everything else.  Therapists, medication,surgery, yoga, physiotherapy, weed, alcohol.  Ironically, the weed has halped me more than anything bar the surgery itself.  Oh, and lets not talk about the surgery.  I’m currently studying to be part of a profession I have lost faith in.  Doctors and the Canadian medical system have let me down.  Ever since I could comprehend medicine, I knew that doctors would always make it better.  I know better now.  Ive come to peace with the unfairness I’ve had to endure.  

No one ever believed me.  No one knows what I feel.  Recently, I’ve come to accept that.  Even I am often confused as to what I’m feeling.  I’ll find myself pumping myself up while listening to Linkin Park, only to start crying because I know its hopeless.  Hopeless.   You know those bullshit teamwork-building exercises schools made you do?  “If you had to describe yourself in one word, what would it be?”  I guess the one good outcome of all this is that I can confidently answer that question truthfully.  Hopeless.  That word describes me.   It describes my entire being.  

I used to want to fight.  Fight through these problems.  Watch some inspirational youtube video which would get me going.  Over the past month or so, all that fight has drained out of me.  I’ve tried drumming it up, but I’m banging on an empty drum.  The thought of suicide enters my head far too often.  You know that stupid misconception that men think about sex every 6 seconds?  I think about killing myself every 6 minutes.  

And yet, I think I’m brave.  I’ve made it this far.  I’d like to think I’ve handled this much better than most people.  I’ve seen girls crying after they failed a quiz, and I’d be thinking, “They don’t know what real pai is.”  Real pain is…indescribable.  I cannot put into words what it feels like.  But this pain, this suffering, has made me a better person.  I don’t judge anymore.  How can I judge others, when anyone on the outside looking at me would see a failure?  They don’t know me.   Many others would crumble under the pressure, but fuck that man.  I couldn’t care less about what others think of me.  I just care about what my family thinks of me, and most importantly, what I think of me.

So here I am, sitting in a two-million-dollar house, drinking special edition Macallan (SIDE NOTE: this is delicious) in expensive clothes, on a custom-made sofa, which is on a Turkish rug, and I doesn’t make me feel anything.  Whisky snobs would turn in their graves if they saw how I poured my glass.  Ideally, Id love to use one of our many lovely rocks glasses sitting in the bar, but I don’t want my family to think I’m drinking.  They think that I might turn into an alcoholic and drug addict.  So, I use the regular IKEA water tumblers.  I didn’t pour myself a single or a double.  I filled the glass halfway.  The only thing that would make it even more cringe worthy would be if I added some coke to it.  

I do think that me hiding my drinking habits from my parents is symbolic of the rest of my life.  I’ve hid so much from them.  Not because I’m doing bad things.  I’ve never abused alcohol or drugs in my life.  The only recreational drugs I’ve ever touched was weed.  I’ve stayed away from everything else.  I’m a responsible drinker.  Never drinking too much; always staying safe.  But my parents to this day don’t believe me.  And Im not sure if I blame them or not.  I’ve always lied to get out of trouble, but the trouble Id be trying to get out of has always been juvenile and harmless.  

I know this rambling vent is hardly coherent or organized, but that’s how I feel.  Nothing works properly.  Its like my body and mind is a jigsaw puzzle comprised only of mismatched pieces.  I do the best I can, fitting square pieces through round pegs, but the results are predictably  dismal.  To be honest, I don’t know what the fuck I;m going to do.

On October 27th, 2017, I got a girlfriend.  Shagun.  She’s amazing, and I have immense feelings for her, but I’m keeping myself apart from her.  She truly cares for me, and I for her, which is why I want to keep her away from all this turbulence.  Why would I want to bring her into these stormy waters after I’ve seen whats its done to my family?  She’s messaging me right now, wishing me a merry Christmas.  I’m ignoring them for now.

I’ve never written so much so quickly.  I wish I was this motivated in school, Id get all those bullshit essays done in no time.  

Im done writing for one night.   Every Christmas, my sister wakes me up and I go down with her to the family room, where the tree is.  We spend some quality time as a family opening presents.  For the first time in my life, I will not be joining them.  Christmas is a time of pure joy.  It feels almost sacrilegious to attend when there is nothing but darkness in my heart.  I do not want to corrupt their experience.

I always wanted to be a teacher, so I went to the university and studied the subjects German Language and History. I did get good grades, but I also realized that my social life would probably never change. Neither did I find new friends nor a girlfriend. And every time I mustered up the courage to ask someone out I got rejected. But still, the thought of becoming a teacher kept me going. So I graduated the university with honours and started the last step in becoming a teacher: working at a school. This was the time were the failures began. Since I had to move away from the university town, I didnt know any people and since I have socially unacceptable hobbies (Video Games, Anime, Manga, Board Games) I couldnt make any new connections. Meanwhile my work was going poorly and my superiors already mentioned that I would fail the practical exam. And so I did, and the Re-Try also failed. Now I could never become a teacher and was unemployed for almost a year.

I am now in a new education for a job in the law system, which I found to be quite appealing. I think in America it would be called a Citizen Representative. Its not what I wanted, but still acceptable. But my old social problems are still with me. Since I moved to a new town I tried to make friends and become more likeable, but it all failed. Nobody asks me if we want to do something together and should I ask, people „dont have time“ or „maybe another time“. Should I write a text message I usually dont get a response at all. Same thing with women, they either already have a boyfriend and are happy and if they dont have one they arent interested in me either. Even a girl that shared my hobbies doesnt care about me. 

In summary, I am now 28 years old, failed at my dream job, have no friends, never had a girlfriend, never had sex.

So, why should I go on?

52,"I'm so tired of this I am so freakin tired of having this disorder and the cycling and the random mood swings and the hallucinations and all the other stuff that comes with it. I'd been doing so well lately, but the past few days I've been getting kind of sad. Warning: this will be a rant.

Last night I went with my best friend to a game night/kickback thing with her coworkers at one of their houses, and I was having so much fun. They're all teachers and one of them mentioned mental illness and people being off their meds (they were joking about a weird sub they had recently and said she might be off her meds) and it moved to the subject of mentally ill people teaching kids. One of them said no mentally ill person will ever teach her kids.

My best friend cut in and said if they're on meds and stable and everything it doesn't matter, they can lead a completely healthy lifestyle and be perfectly capable of teaching kids. The others all disagreed, my bestie continued to stick up for people with mental illness (she knows about mine, of course, but didn't mention it), and the subject changed. What they said kinda hurt, but whatever.

Then later another one was telling a story about how she got mad at someone and went ""psychotic"". She told the full story and she definitely had *not* gone psychotic. I don't think she knows what psychotic means. It irritated me. They were all super nice and meant no harm, but I'm tired of these stereotypes.

I'm tired of the stigma and having this stupid illness! When my best friend and I left I started crying and had a full on breakdown, started freaking out because I thought this was be the beginning of another depressive episode and it could last who knows how long and I was scared and wanted to make it stop. She comforted me but she was exhausted and an uber was on the way to take her home, so she left while I was still upset. 

I'm not mad about it. She's literally always there when I need her, and she did her best last night. I had to hide how upset I was from my mom when I went inside because I hate getting pity when I'm sad and crying. I don't want this mental illness. I just wanna be normal. That's all I want. I woke up feeling perfectly fine today so my freakout last night over going into depression was for nothing. I'm okay again, just tired. I am so, so fucking tired. 

I don't wanna harm myself in any way, but I don't want to do this for the rest of my life. I don't know if I can. I'm tired of medication changes. I'm tired of psychosis. I'm tired of depression, and mania, and night terrors and panic attacks and having to make constant appointments and pop pills every fucking day to try and avoid something I know will inevitably happen again. I'm so tired, I just want it to stop.",bipolar,ID1384_bipolar,"

1422,"Suicidal ideation but not depressed? I'm sure this has been answered a million times, but I can't find an answer that fits my specific situation, so wanted to ask myself.  I don't know if I should post this in /suicidewatch because I'm sitting at work thinking about this and won't go home tonight or in the future to try and commit suicide, but I will move it there if people think it's more appropriate there.

I think about suicide a lot. At least once a day but probably more, and it isn't a fleeting though; I dwell on it.  Recently my favorite band lost its lead singer to suicide and when I found out the method, the first thing that came into my head was ""yeah, this is how I'd do it too.""  Yesterday I was driving down the road and couldn't really shake the idea of ""yeah, I could totally just slam my car into this highway median going 90mph,"" and almost felt a physical tension as my conscious mind restrained my arm from turning the wheel.

That being said, I'm not actively suicidal in that I don't want to die, and while I was diagnosed with depression ten years ago when I was a Peace Corps volunteer, it was largely considered a malpractice diagnosis and was situational at best.  

I don't mind being alive, and I have fun with the people I love, do the things I'm interested in doing, have an amazing family who loves me, etc.  A lot of the time I feel happy.  I just get really tired sometimes (a lot), everything seems like a hassle to a degree, and in areas of my life professionally especially, I feel like I'm always coasting on mediocre and feel like I'll always be mediocre / kind of lost in what I'm doing (and if someone feels otherwise and that I'm doing really well, it's because somehow I pulled the wool over their eyes).  I can't concentrate on ANYTHING.  It takes a lot to get me out of the house to do social things, but once I do, I enjoy myself, and I travel a lot.  Life simultaneously seems like it's flying by and like it's creeping along.  

Is this normal?  Is this something I should be worried about? I'm having a hard time even verbalizing this in a way that I feel like makes sense. ",depression,ID11820_depression,"

3054,"Ex is stalking me. I feel like there's no other way out. Obvious throwaway...

My fiance and I broke up over two months ago. We made a mistake getting engaged this young, and he quickly became a different person than I'd known him as for years. He got really controlling.

I broke up with him, and ended up having a one night stand with a friend afterward (fiance and I had a nonexistent sex life due to his E.D., I was pent up.)

He went on to lie to everyone I know and tell them I cheated on him, when I didn't. I tried to be civil with him, but he kept telling me to kill myself and saying really awful cruel things to me.

After several back and forths of him blocking and unblocking me, I finally gave up and said goodbye forever and blocked him and cut him out.

He keeps contacting all my friends and family online, even people I don't speak to but went to the same school as. It's nonstop. I keep getting messages asking why he's messaging them.

I don't know what to do. My family believes everything he said about me and won't block him even though I begged them to so I could stop hearing about him and find peace. They still talk to him. This has been going on for two months and I don't think he's ever going to stop.

We are from different countries (US/CA) so any type of legal action I could take would be complicated, and I don't know if I could do anything at all. I am pretty sure I can't legally request he not speak to anyone I know.

I'm at the point where I honestly feel suicidal because I don't know what else to do. He won't let me find closure and heal. He won't let me forget. He is determined to keep my wounds fresh and open...

Edit, afterthought: I've made all my social media accounts as private as I can. He has his witchhunt group stalking my reddit account to watch my post history. I wouldn't be surprised if he or they find this post and recognize it as me. It's never going to stop.  I was clean of self harming for almost 6 years, and now I'm self harming almost every day.

73,"How I feel everyday Depression it’s a bitch.
Its like there is a constant voice in your head telling you that you are worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, a disappointment that you don’t deserve happiness or to be alive but to only feel pain. It makes you feel like you are forever trapped in an abyss with no way of crawling out. Sometimes you can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it always drags you back deeper than you’ve gone before and the impossible cycle of escaping begins again. No matter how much you try to escape the darkness, your brain yearns for the dark thoughts to return because it happens so frequently that it becomes the comfort zone for it. 
You begin to doubt everything about yourself; telling yourself whatever you do isn’t good enough and you should just stop trying or its worthless to just go on and might be better to just end it all. You feel like you are nothing and will be important to anyone ever and when you are gone everyone will be happier knowing the pathetic failure that they once knew will be gone forever and can no longer fuck up their lives. 
All the smiles on the outside is just a mask to cover how you really feel. You cut because you feel like you deserve the sharp stinging sensation as the blade cuts your arm open and the blood slowing oozing out. Afterwards you are left with scars as a constant reminder of the pain you cause others and how worthless you are. ",depression,ID26981_depression,"

I can't sleep at night, but I always wake up at 10:00 no matter what. After I wake up, I can't go back to sleep again. A lot of the day I'm on the verge of tears, but a lot of the time I can't cry. Not anymore, at least. The only way I can sleep at night is if I tell myself that I might not wake up tomorrow, and that all of this will be over. All of the fucking pain I feel every single day will be gone. But I wake up every morning, and I hate that I'm still here.

Almost daily, I would cut to try and feel calm again. It helped. The only person who knew was my then-girlfriend. She was the only person and still is the only person who I've been able to talk with about this. Nobody else would understand; not the people I used to speak with, and not the one friend I have right now. My family doesn't understand this either. They think it's just me ""feeling sorry for myself."" I'm ""lazy"" for not having the energy to get out of bed some mornings, and I'm ""anti-social"" for not being able to leave the house because I'm so sad sometimes. It's been just over seven months since I last cut; 15th May 2017. I don't know how much longer I can go. And I don't even feel any sense of accomplishment. I feel regret that I haven't cut. It feels like I've been pointlessly making myself suffer.

Nothing brings me joy. It's almost Christmas, but I'm not as excited as I was, for example, a year or two ago. I felt pretty shitty then, too, but it's gotten worse now. I don't want to do any of this. I don't want to be a productive member of society. I don't want to contribute. I don't want anything. I don't want to _exist_. I didn't ask for this. Some days I just want to commit suicide and be done with it. As soon as I start to feel even a little bit better, everything goes to shit again. I think about my ex and how much I fucking miss her, I think about how I'm never going to be a functional member of society, and I think about how much of a joke being alive is. I don't want to do this anymore, but I'm too afraid to kill myself. For now, anyway. Anyone I've spoken to hasn't understood why I feel this way. They either say it's not depression or that I just need to get out more. Pretty sure that's not what this is. They haven't done anything practical. I don't know why I feel this way but I don't want life anymore. I miss how things used to be, when I had friends and when things brought me a small amount of joy.

Why the hell am I still here, and when is it going to end?",depression,ID15820_depression,"

fast forward to october, when teachers released our predicted grades for university. mine weren’t good enough and it completely broke me. i’ve said some bad things to people, been extremely stressed (and started overeating, leading to weight gain and extreme depression cause of it smh).

i ended up having to quit my part time job, drop most of my friends, never leave the house, absolutely neglect people i cared about. just to do well. and to make it even more fucking tragic i’m doing even worse.

Another analogy was saying it felt like my brain has limewire installed. I’ll be fine for a week, then I’m back to wishing someone would come snuff me in my sleep, just strangle what little remains. The emotional drain I experience every day has robbed me of any enjoyment I had before. 

When my ex abruptly left me, I lost weight, which is the opposite of what I’d want because now the one thing I always had (weight lifting) is fucked too. Weights I used to move with ease now feel colossal. 
I tried to have sex with this girl the other night, couldn’t. Couldn’t do it, because it just reminded me that I loved my ex, and I didn’t love the girl in my bed. When my girlfriend and I had sex it meant something. We thought we’d never be apart. Well now we are, and I can’t even get my fucking dick to work to forget about her. 

It feels like I can’t even live my life. Why should I? Just so I can meet someone great and repeat the cycle? I go to counseling. I take the SSRIs, I go out. I try to stay productive. It’s all groundhog’s day. It’s like the light in my life’s burnt out and I’m just ready to go. I went from having everything in my life I’d wanted to getting it all stripped away week by week in October.

  It has been a while since I've been on here, I'm hopeful on an off chance someone will remember the last post I made from another thrower. I was struggling with depression and this girl really helped and I got some good advice. I wanted to update and speak my mind on current issues. I'll start with background I've attempted 6 times I (m 16) have struggled with depression since I can remember. I have gone back and forth from amazing to not getting out of bed for a week. My last post I talked about two girls one I had a small 3 week fling with who used tried using me for sex and was almost as abusive as my first girlfriend. The second girl (was F17 is F18) we'll call O who I'd been dating for about five months, one day before five months she told me she'd been seeing her ex. O and I shared a couple classes (1 We perm shared, and a couple others that would intigrate [intrgt as our school called it] roughly a third of the time.) we would sneak off and make out a lot. She constantly would be getting handsy under the tables in class and one time she gave me head when we were the only two in the classroom. I really loved her but I got sent into absolute hell when I heard that she didn't care about me. I then got involved with this other girl we had a thing and she was like I don't really want to be public and texted her ex… ALOT even though she claimed he was abusive (he wasn't turns out she's an attention whore.) and then I met this girl I fell in love with her on sight. Well call her R(F16) she and I have been dating for 3 months. R makes me feel like no other person has (yes including O) and I'm worried because she makes me so happy and yet I still feel like killing myself sometimes. I hate this feeling idk what to do because I'm sitting here looking a vile of mercury that I stole from school but I love R and I am just at a loss for words I just don't know.

My girlfriend broke up with me a month ago. We were dating for 2 years. There weren't any huge problems between us, except for one: university started and she realized she was young. Fuck, I can't talk about it because I constantly tear up.  
I have a friend. She's friends with both me and my ex. She doesn't understand why the hell we broke up (we were the 'perfect match' couple in our circle), so she's helping me through this...  
But... today I felt even worse than before. I just can't forget her. Her smile, her voice... And when I wanted to speak with my friend, it kinda felt like she didn't really want to help me anymore. I totally get it, she has her own life, and I imagine I'm quite annoying and whiny too. But I feel helpless. It's been a month and nothing changed. In fact, it's even worse! I had other girlfriends before my ex, but I recovered from their break ups in a month or few. This time... I just want to die.  
I was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago. It runs in the family, so it wasn't suprising. I met my love back then. After a few months of therapy and medicine, depression disappeared into the shadows. Now I feel I want to die and cease to exist, but I don't feel depression. I'm afraid it will return, but luckily, nothing happened so far. Still, I just want to disappear. Forever. I know I should distract myself, and I've been trying. I started playing around in FL Studio, I play Dark Souls 3 (which is awesome) and I'm concentrating on my studies (programming). I've even gone on dates with other girls. Yesterday, I spent ten hours with a girl. She is a beautiful person. It was one of the greatest dates I've ever had.  
But it's still bad. I don't feel any progress towards a normal life. I feel like giant chains are holding me down, and no matter how many things are pulling me up, I'm stuck.

556,"Does anybody else wish they'd get the gift of a ""good"" death? Question in title. I feel like I've wanted to stop living for a while now but I know suicide's off the table because:


* It hurts the people that care about me (my family)
* It makes them think ""they should have done something"" or that they failed in raising me
* It makes talking about my death (and therefore my life) taboo, because to many suicide is seen as selfish and ""the coward's way out""
* It makes the grieving process much more difficult (due to the reasons I've listed above)


On the other hand, if I died saving a baby from a burning building, or in war time, my death would be seen as a ""heroic sacrifice."" I'd be featured on the news and the community would rally around my family to give them support during the grieving process. They'd be able to talk about my death openly, as opposed to if I committed suicide where they'd have to kick it under the rug like I'm the shame of the family (which I guess I am/I would be.) I know it's such a fucked up line of thought (the concept of ending your life when man's only discernible reason for existing in this world is to exist and continue existing is in itself fucked up so much it defies basic human logic) but I've had a few near-death experiences (two serious illnesses and a car crash) in my life, and I keep feeling like I wish they'd have actually happened instead of just being a close call. It would've been a much cleaner, much more digestible (for my family) way to go. And this isn't about me caring about my legacy, either: if not for my family I'd have probably killed myself long ago. I don't care what people think about me, but I care about the people I'd leave behind and wish so much there was a way for me to end my pain without causing them any.

I don’t mind crying when there’s a cause. And to be honest, I actually don’t usually cry when there IS a cause. So to be crying when there isn’t a viable cause ... it just feels pathetic.

I had thoughts of suicide while at the acupuncturist. I don’t, usually, and I know that by putting it out there like this, there’s a greater chance that I won’t - I wouldn’t, anyway - but ... it’d be a lot easier for me. Not anyone else, I know. But it’d just stop everything for me.

I went to a top tier school and was so stupid that I threw that opportunity away by pursuing my stupid passion in a degree that is completely useless for anything but academia and I was rejected from every grad school to which I applied. I am stuck back home in my one-horse town with no irl friends and 0 opportunities for socializing, assuming I could even get off my lazy ass to do anything. I tried to start a fitness program because I completely despise my fat body but I fell off the wagon almost immediately. At least I didn't fail after over a year of strength training and watching calories, losing 30 pounds but measurements and photos staying exactly the same, like the last time I tried. I've hated myself for literally as long as I can remember and have depression and anxiety. I am also cursed with awful treatment-resistant acne, socially anxious, depressed, lazy, undisciplined, inconsiderate, a secret perv, and, unsurprisingly, a kissless virgin, which stings even more because my greatest desire in life is to someday find love and start a family. Oh, and it's time for grad applications again so I have to try and sell how ""Awesome"" I am to the same people who decided I wasn't worth a second glance last year. And to top it all off, the one bright spot in my life, my mother, is so exhausted from work that I hardly ever see her after dinner even though we're in the same house, plus I feel like a parasite because I am draining so much money from her because I couldn't get my ass to apply for a job until September and I'm still just getting the training and clearance for that job. So far she's had to pay for 6 months of extra food, a road trip for my friend's wedding, a car accident, and an extra car so I could actually get to that job. 

So the reason I'm posting this is to ask: how? Everyone keeps saying there's light at the end of the tunnel and things will get better, but how?

I cant bear to see 2018 as another year of nothing.Waiting for adult Asperger's testing.I'm tired of being poor.I hate waking up in the morning because its another day where I'm nothing.I'm tired of never having what I need.I'm tired of my cracked molars that Medicaid wont pay for a root canal for.I'm tired of homeless men in my neighborhood harassing me while I can't even get one decent man in a decent rich area to take a chance on me.If you are poor &amp; dare to look at a rich man then you're a gold digger.I just want a better life.If you aren't Donald Trump or Mitt Romney with a rich inheritance your life sucks,period.I'm tired of being a lazy sack of failure.I'm tired of being the family bank because one of my two brothers has spent the last 9 yrs in prison,since age 19,because of armed robbery.He got tired of a life with no future in the south.I'm the oldest in yrs but youngest in mentality &amp; power in the family.I'm deaf in my right ear &amp; tinnitus that will never go away.I have hair that turns curly the second moisture hits it so I wear a satin scarf all the time.I'm half Black &amp; half Arab but can't escape the curse of internalized racism.I know its wrong to think that way but society pushes straight blond hair,Size 2 dresses &amp; soprano voices.The only black male role model I had was my father who couldn't lift his family out of poverty.


I'm tired of everything....maybe I am a drifter but I wont be dictated what to do in my life just because people with money make homelessness illegal.It is not illegal to sleep at night.It is not illegal to be a human being.


All I want is a successful acting career,a modest home in the Hollywood Hills &amp; someone like Michael Fassbender,Taron Egerton or Dan Stevens to love me.I will never have anyone close to their greatness.I just turned 30 on Dec 9th &amp; I will never have any of them.I've never been kissed.I've never had a boyfriend.I've never has a husband.I have my controlling family to thank for that.They have the crab bucket mentality at its worst.Because I am alone however lonely for the right kind of man,not the wrong one,I talk to myself when I'm alone about everything.I am not schizophrenic,just anxious,depressed &amp; a failure in all things.Because I am anxious around people.Because thanks to my pathetic upbringing I have no idea how to be a human being.Because I used to be 125 lbs but now I am 150 lbs &amp; can't change that because everything has carbs.


I can't bear January 1st because its another year that I'm the same sack of failure.I just want this painful existence to end.I need an eraser for myself.Nothing has ever panned out for me.I don't want to hear that things will change or Hallmark platitudes.They say that you can work yourself out of anything.

That is not true.

4972,"I dont know how to make myself better. I know there's something not right with me, whether it's a chemical deficiency in my brain or my personality is fucked or something.

Im 15 and I can feel so alone sometimes. I don't relate to anyone, I genuinely haven't felt close to another person in years, even when we're doing things that close people do together. I feel so detached and deficient. I tell myself happiness is a choice, and it's only my own fault that I am the way I am, so I lost 40lbs and tried to change my outlook and clean my room more. I stopped caring about what other people think of me.

But I still feel so... Wrong. I just want to feel not so alone. I want to moan about all this horribleness inside of me with someone but they can't relate, and Id feel stupid anyway.

What do I do? I can't get help and that's not pessimism- I've tried. But I'm wondering now to feel normal again. Because sometimes I just want to not be alive anymore. I want to give up but I've no clue how. Tell me what I'm missing, how to help myself, and I'll do it. I believe you can improve your own situation, but maybe I'm getting it all wrong or I'm not trying hard enough.

I don't even know who I am. I wonder sometimes if I ever did. The only thing that makes me feel human anymore is memories of who I used to be when I was like 11~, when I knew I was a functioning human being who can make relationships with people. But that's hardly something to hold onto.

God knows I've tried.

This is all so self-pitying. I can't even maintain any relationships, it can make me feel so alone. I got a boyfriend a few months ago, my first one, but I can feel so exhausted and drained trying to seem okay for him. And sometimes I'm just a cunt hair away from totally giving all over him and being an utter steaming misery.

This was a ramble.

I don't feel like a person anymore. I honestly feel like I'm fucked in the head. Yesterday I was working with my SO (yeah yeah don't date co-workers, she was different), I started having a massive anxiety attack. My anxiety loves convincing me that other people hate me. If I knew someone I, at one point, convinced myself they hated me. Well this was happening with my SO. She's not a very affectionate person, she's told me multiple times, yet my anxiety still wanted to say otherwise. I thought her not being affectionate was just a cover up for not liking me and not wanting to confront me about it.

Work flared up, it got hella busy and we're under staffed as shit, so it's really tense and fast paced. Not good for anxiety attacks. At one point my mind felt like it literally shut down. My anxiety was beating the shit out of me. I had to fight back tears because I convinced myself that we were on the verge of breaking up.

I caved in and tried to talk to my co-worker (good friends) about it, but it only made the tears burst out. I had a full mental break down during work. My SO had to confront me about it and tell me everything was ok, and that I needed to chill out. Honestly I feel like that in itself hurt our relationship.

After work I talked to my mother about going back on anxiety pills (Zoloft), and she gave me 2 weeks worth of hers and scheduled a doctors appointment to get me a proper prescription. I've took the pill before bed yesterday, and going to take it again today.

I just don't feel right after that incident. It was humiliating breaking down in tears in front of everybody. I don't know why I did that, I've been fine for 3 years but recently my anxiety has gone through the roof. I feel like I'm starting to degrade into a psychotic piece of shit. I just want to feel normal again. I just feel so inhuman.

I am relatively new to accepting that I have real depression. I've always been taught to be strong, be the master of your mind, and that you control how you feel. I believed in that for the first 28 years of my life. Only recently, when things have gotten worse than they ever have before (~the last 3 years or so), have I become OK with admitting that I have an issue, and its not a weakness. I was in denial. Only in the last month or so, have I been ok with talking about it. First, on threads, then finally getting the courage to post here. 

I just need to know that there are people out there that feel like I do. That feel so overwhelmed at every little thing that they feel like giving up. That get so low sometimes that nothing can make them smile genuinely. That feel they are absolutely worthless, and are incapable of success at anything. 

I feel that im destined to be a piece of shit nobody.  I am currently in college, in my third semester. I crushed the first two semesters, averaging a 3.23GPA. At the beginning of this semester, I was accepted into Nursing School here in Colorado, that starts in the spring. Its a really competitive program, so im proud of that. But, I have to do well this current semester to keep my spot, and like clockwork, im fucking everything up. Its just so hard for me to find the motivation to give a fuck about it, even though it hurts me to continue to fail in life. I feel like im drowning. Im very, very scared at what will happen to my psychological state if I fail and lose my spot in nursing school, but I cannot seem to dig myself out of this pit of which has become my home.",depression,ID37821_depression,"

Inherently it wanders getting lost from time to time 

Mistaking truth for shadows tangling up in twisting vines

So lioness aggress my doubtful mind


Warrior pierce my bleeding heart 

Its agony for love I fear will tear itself apart

Afraid to face the smoking dim lit mirror eclipsing its own spark

So warrior pierce my bleeding heart

Lover understand my reckless ways 


After all you taught me it takes light to find the shade

I've wandered all my life to know the solace of your gaze

So lover understand my reckless ways

Father please take pride in all my days


It's hard watching you wither while your light remains the same

Our joy is cloaked in sorrow for we all must fade away

So father please take pride in all my days

Mother may you cradle me in love


Your voice is soothing like the cooing of a turtle dove

Absent of your warmth my gaze turns upward toward the sun

I'm blind when I'm not cradled in your love

Brother may you take me as I am


Never to retreat though at the gates of hell we stand

Anytime you stumble I'll be there at your command

So brother may you take me as I am

Sister may I sweeten your bitter tongue


Hosting fiendish ghosts that hold your blooming spirit down

There's no need to fight just float the rhythm of this song

So sister may I sweeten your bitter tongue

Daughter keep a green tree in your heart


A little bird will come and your bright eyes will be besot

When you let it go it will always wander home

So cultivate the green tree in your heart

Little bird make this green tree your nest


Singing sweet the melody that whispers in the wind

Tranquilize equanimity the energy within

Oh Little bird make this green tree your nest

Son bask in all life's wonder while you can


One day you'll talk about it but you'll never understand

How all these little treasures used to fit inside your hand

So son bask in all life's wonder while you can

John baptise me in God's holy light


Pour over me like Saul and shed the scales from my eyes

Rendering my soul while straightening my crooked spine

So John baptise me in God's holy light

Judas betray me with your soft kiss


For thirty silver dollars lead them to my garden bed

I love you all the more for you know not what you did

So Judas betray me with your soft kiss

Child may I fuel your growing flame


As our youth begins to fade so does our little fire dim

Forgotten beneath bushels stifled both by fear and blame

So child may I fuel your growing flame

Our feelings they are waves atop the crest


Crashing on foreign beaches smoothing stones and sifting sand

We gather them in buckets but we still are just a speck

Our feelings they are waves atop to crest


Arctic shard please house my lone spark


Steal away the pleasures of the warmth beneath my hearth

Alone without these comforts I will grow to love the dark

So Arctic shard please house my lone spark


And once we've walked our lonely paths enough to grow

Perhaps our threads will cross and we will build ourselves a home

Before our hearts are too broke down to leave we oughtta go
It's ok to be alone


Then Earth I will join in your cosmic dance

Flowing through my body the electrostatic transe

Treading murky waters glow the infinite expanse

Oh Earth I will join in your cosmic dance


Cosmos I will breathe your ancient tome

Through entropy and agony I'll hum the ancient drone

The peak of evolution is loving everything that grows

So cosmos I will breathe your ancient tome

The majority of my inspiration and motivation comes from you which sounds so weird. I try to imagine how awesome of a duo we would be; I’m the loud and obnoxious one, and you are the quiet intelligence. Of course, it wouldn’t be exactly like that, but you get what I mean. Anyways, I get my hopes up about the idea of  us. I am always trying to act cooler, so you would notice me (I’m judging myself too). It’s pathetic because I look at the two separate lives we live, and it just proves why it wouldn’t work out. You are productive and busy. Your life is organized, planned out, and you have priorities and expectations to meet. I, however, am quite the opposite. My plans are either nonexistent or spontaneous. I don’t do well with routine or organization. You’re reliable and careful. I’m too reckless for anyone to depend on me. It’s easier for you to hide how you feel, while I wear my emotions like a badge. I literally take antidepressants to function. I know you would never want to be with a person like me.

1548,"Was in a relationship, fell in love with someone else. Now I'm out of that relationship but I obviously ""friendzoned"" this person I'm in love with so as to not be disloyal to ex. Now I can't undo it. I ""friendzoned"" this person I'm in love with because I was in a relationship at the time. This person I’m in love with, let’s call them “J”, we’ve been talking since August. Anyway, my relationship was bad and abusive and I ended it last month. 

Because I held J at arm’s length,they basically think there'll never have a chance with me even though, though J refuses to make it explicit at all (I suspect they feel they'd rather die than admit it), they are very clearly into me and the flirtation is reaaaal lol. J and I are still good friends though and we talk often.

Fast forward to more recently and J is flirting with someone new, maybe to try and get over me IF they have feelings for me. How can I even blame them for that? It hurts a LOT but I don't want to risk confessing my feelings for them because they might reject me. I've tried before with J to be more emotionally forthcoming but they're not good with emotions - I’ve said more general things to let them know my feelings, “I love being friends with you/I love talking to you.” They now find it difficult to say these things to me, but are upset when I seem to be not giving them attention and make it clear in their actions that they want to be close to me. 

I hate myself because I did this. I friendzoned them when I was lowkey in love with them and now I can't take it back. To ""hold them at arm's length"", I deliberately created a relationship with J that was based on being (jokingly) *mean* to each other/roasting each other but it meant there was little room for being emotionally honest or kind. This was in response in the beginning to them teetering on being extremely flirtatious and their attraction was very apparent. I was scared that my ex (Who is abusive) would find out so I tried to control the situation and remain friends with J without making them think they'd have a shot with me (at this point I was still desperately trying to make my relationship work with my ex). 

Anyway, they eventually ""got the message"" but now they’ve got to the extreme with this “mean dynamic"" between us. Interactions between us now revolve mostly around being ""unkind""/roasting each other. Recently they've taken it too far as well, and their jokes can be VERY personal, jokes implying I’m ugly, undateable (they know I just got out of a relationship too), that I’m cold and “have no soul” etc. I tried telling them their jokes go too far and hurt,and how I’m sensitive right now, and they said they ""didn't mean it/they're a nice person"" but the jokes continue anyway. 

I hate myself because I did this. I pushed away someone I think I've fallen in love with, or at least am intensely crushing on. Now as much as I try to be kind to this person to restore things almost to how they were in the beginning between us, they're still just not the same with me (the way they used to be). 

Recently I feel used by them. I feel like I bother them when I talk to them (but my therapist said that’s likely just my own stuff/social anxiety).  I'm struggling on what to believe - whether they actually like anything about me, or just who I am (they've alluded to the fact that they love certain physical characteristics about me, my nationality, my accent, that kind of thing). It’s difficult to interpret but I don’t know if they genuinely have any interest in who I am as a person, but rather, how I seem like a “trophy” to them (believe me, I don’t think this). Do they actually like me for me or because they're attracted to me? 

If it was just the latter, wouldn’t they have given up and stopped talking to me by now, realising they didn’t have a chance? They are not kind in their words but their actions signal they want to be close to me sometimes. I'm getting mixed signals. They do make an effort to talk to me, they send me morning snaps sometimes, I mentioned once that I'm interested in seeing what they eat and they make a point to take photos of whatever they eat (even if it's just cereal lol). A few weeks ago they made up a bogus reason to spend eight hours with me over two days to ""help"" them with something they didn't need me for/I have no knowledge of at all.  Though (maybe because of my low self esteem) sometimes I've been wondering recently if they just use me when they're bored or have no one to talk to. Sometimes I do worry they're just a flirt and I may have stupidly caught feelings for someone who flirts with everyone. They seem interested in this new person now yet still interested in me. I don’t know what to do. I’m just very, very confused right now. 

It hurts A LOT. To the point I feel empty and numb, can’t even cry about it. Seeing them flirt with this person last night just killed me inside. I don’t know how to continue - should I cut contact with them and try and move on? It would be less painful than this right now. There’s no way I’ll tell them how I really feel, it’s ridiculous. I know in maybe a day or two they’re probably gonna hit me up again in some way and I don’t know what to do about it. Do I ignore them? I feel like if I interacted with them right now I’d just end up being irrationally angry and attacking them when they haven’t done anything. Don’t want to do that to them.

3413,"Tolerance Hi all. This is just going to be a sort of monologue of mine, you don't have to read or upvote it. I am posting it here because I believe it's a safe space and I also think that someone might read it.

I called up a friend telling him that I didn't wish to attend any future class meet ups, because of certain people in my class. I felt some of them had done atrocious things to me which I was very hurt and angered about. 

When he heard this, he told me that I should let it go and even though he had been f ked over by the same persons, he didn't hold grudges towards them or anything or the sort.

When I heard this, I had the thought in the back of my mind: why is my friend so disrespectful towards himself? Someone previously f ked you over and yet you're still able to get over it and ignore it. How?

Then I realized perhaps they were just tolerant. Tolerant of people giving them shit. I'm not though. People who have done shit to me won't get their just desserts. I don't want revenge, I only want to run the f k away from these people as far as possible. I want to never ever see them again.

Talking to them feels like I am disrespecting myself, I could never do that. I don't want to be like my friend who acts like a fucking slave; he becomes friends with people that fucked them over because friend = good.

Don't you see you're making a mistake? Why do you even think of tolerating nonsensical people? It's disgusting to me really.

As time goes by I can hardly even see the goodness in people anymore. They show me one side of their badness I remember it forever. I don't bother using it against them or whatever. I just run.

I am 16 and I have been given everything I could want. I have never gone hungry and I have never lived without a roof over my head. My body is not being ravaged by a painful disease, and I am not abused by anyone. By any normal measure it seems like I should be very happy and satisfied with life, but for some reason I am not. I have friends and family who seem to care greatly for me but there is a deep emptiness that I feel each day. It feels like a part of my chest is missing and there is a cavitiy of emptiness inside me. I crave a deep romantic connection with someone but I have sort of accepted that I am unlikable to seemingly every girl. Im not exepctionally ugly or anything, I just think I as a person am probably not interesting or attractive to any girl. Even my junkie brother and wacky stoner friends found relationships but I am just fundementally not good enough. I often wake up thinking about killing myself and go through my whole day with the thought in my head. The only reason I have not killed myself is the fact that my mother would be devastated, so I basically live for her pleasure not my own. I do not always feel depressed but when i do it really sinks in how worthless I am. I recently thought I was going to have a respite from my condition but like every other girl I have ever been involved with, she seems to have gotten uninterested and is probably annoyed by me.

But I always go through phases or times where I really like him and other moments I don't like him and etc. I don't know what to do since I don't want to lead him on but I am so confused. I am sometimes afraid of if I do get more flirty or intimate with him that later what if I feel those feelings of ""not liking him and etc"". I guess at times where I question if I really like him I begin to think that I am only liking him for the attention he's giving me since I have depression and have felt lonely for a long time. While other times I look back at moments where I was with him and how I liked him and felt something. So i don't know what to do. I feel so stuck and just unsure of how to handle this.

Edit: Also a part of me feels that I am pushing him away since I am battling with depression and feel sort of like I don't deserve such love or attention (btw I was looking into this online and it seems like people with depression often do that, push people away). I know he could be a really good thing for me, he is outgoing and actually has a social life. Where as I am often doing nothing and trapped in my thoughts and anxiety on my bed.

515,"If you've ever been hospitalized and dealt with it poorly, how long did it take you to get over it? Just some quick context: About two weeks ago, I was going through a particularly rough time because of work, being off my medication (I had stopped about three weeks prior), and the recent sudden death of my uncle. I was forcibly admitted to a psychiatric ward because I expressed suicidal ideation and vague intent to my psychiatrist. The thing is, I was going to admit myself the same day anyway in order to take some time away from my job and figure out a better medication regimen.

&amp;nbsp;

The fact that my psychiatrist made it this whole ordeal and had an ambulance called (with police escort) to take me from the clinic to the hospital, added to the awfulness of waiting for 12 hours in the ER for a bed to free up and the general terribleness of being locked up in the kind of ward I was sent to (more like prison than a hospital) has kind of made the whole thing feel traumatic to me. I don't want to seem like a wuss or anything, but the experience was genuinely awful and I hated having my autonomy overridden and disregarded and being treated like human garbage for daring to be ill. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've been out for just over a week now, and while I'm ecstatic to be home, I find myself being overwhelmed with feelings of anger, helplessness, and shame when I think about the hospital. I keep dreaming that I'm back there and trapped there. Again, I know that this is like an overreaction. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and how long it took you to get it out of your system?

3926,"Could I be bipolar? Help please. Hi. I'm looking for the opinion of others on if my symptoms look like Bipolar 2 or not (or what this stuff is).

I am 18 years old, and depressed. I don't know how severely, but I am depressed. I have lived in a home my entire life that has minimalized the solution to pain as being nothing more than an attitude shift. And it's taken its toll in that, whenever my moods change (they are more sudden than most), I believe that it was my fault and that nothing was wrong in the first place. Currently, I am experiencing longer states of sadness/discontent than I ever have, though if I were to draw an emotional throughline I can't really remember a period of time where I wasn't sad.

 I am not happy with anything, not with myself, not with the people who surround me, not with my ""abilities"", not with the possibilities of the future. I don't see the purpose of this world whatsoever and I don't know why I inhabit it. Everything feels completely worthless to me.

I have never attempted suicide, though recently I have guilted myself into believing that I am even weak for not wanting to go through with the pain, as if there's something wrong with that. I have self harmed, though not seriously (if you can even say that), and I do think about ways I could go about killing myself. These thoughts, though less common, have occurred ever since childhood. I remember being 6 and experimenting with how long I could hold my breath, thinking about ending things. 

However these feelings often suddenly drop off. I wonder why I even had them in the first place. I try to get ""better"", meaning I plan creative ideas that never happen because within the week I'm unmotivated again. 

At 18, I don't really know how much of this is just adolescent mood swings, or if it's something more serious. My parents often comment on how my attitude is like night and day, one moment I am showing signs of affection and one moment I am extremely irritable. 

I can think of a couple of instances in my life that had a mania-esque sheen. One of which I remember coming home from a group activity and then falling into a more melancholy, trapped state, where I didn't really know what was happening physically. I remember jumping on the trampoline, cracking jokes with my brother, laughing hysterically, and crying simultaneously. One other night I can remember coming off from a long drive home and delving into a state of sadness for no reason where I placed myself in an attic crawlspace and put a piece of paper 
outside labelling myself as a hybrid animal...

I often scream internally, or want to scream. Ever since I can remember I have had a tick where I continually shake my leg while sitting still...I am fairly socially anxious, and have had the sensation where I've wanted to crawl out of my own skin before.

Am I just being dramatic??",bipolar,ID4920_bipolar,"

It wasn't just any normal breakup though, she cheated on me, used me for my money, and her new bf, days after we broke up, recorded me crying while I was talking to my ex as some sort of revenge. It has really messed up my mind in how I think. I can actually feel myself stop caring less and less, with school, and at work. All of this caused me to want to get away from my highschool with my ex, so I moved to where one of my co-workers goes to school, I would say that move has actually helped me with my suicidal thoughts. She is like my sister in a way, I've been there for her, she has definitely been here for me. I just think sometimes I'm a huge burden on her and one other girl I met who wants to see me get better. I'm always complaining and I can sense the amount of complaining I actually do when I'm talking to those 2 really close friends of mine. Recently they got their hearts broken and all 3 of us swore to never leave each other's side, however they have both moved on from their troubled thoughts and have met people making them happy. I feel like the odd one out in the group because I'm still unhappy with myself and while they are now happy im still constantly complaining to them. I just don't want to lose them in my life, but it feels with how im feeling I'm going to do that. I think about suicide to get this feeling out of my chest for good. I have tried committing suicide once a while ago, and here I am again.. just at my second lowest moment in my life yet again. They tell me it's going to be okay but I have been hearing that for the past who know how many months, and it just seems to be getting worse. And I'm very insecure with myself in trying to talk to other girls. Sounds like some kind of attention seeking post, which at this point I don't even know what anything is anymore. And I can't ask for help from a therapist because of unfortunate situations with my family.

1990,"22 years since the first attempt I've tried to kill myself so many times, I think I'm doing it wrong. I laying here reading the posts on here and I feel like my sadness doesn't come close to theses people. I'm not big on family, and I don't care how they would feel if I died. I do care for my mom tho. I have to take care of her bcuz no one else will, I do have older siblings but nothing there. When I would try to talk about how I feel all I would get is ( that's stupid to feel that way) so I shut down and have become very angry. I feel I'm stuck here because of my mom, but I'm not going to stay anymore I have a plan. I feel like a cliché when I think of everything that has been said before but now I'm saying it. I'm mostly afraid that my mom won't be taking care of by my sibling.  That's y I'm waiting for her to pass so I won't have to worry about that. Yea dead people don't worry I suppose but that stops me. A year and a half ago my husband called the cops on me cuz I took two bottles of my meds full bottles. Lucky for me I'm a good lier and he didn't wait long enough for them to take effect on me. I'm really a sad pathetic person now that I'm reading this. I've always felt no one understood my thoughts and feelings on my life. They jus wanted to be selfish and make me live a life I never wanted nor asked for. I don't have anything to show in this life I was ever here, memories fade like years do. I'm jus a waste of a human and a waste of space that no one loves, they jus tolerate me and they shouldn't have to do that.",suicide_watch,ID29868_suicide_watch,"

It was a slow process, but eventually i got better coping with it and eventually went back to normal; However, i seem to have lost sight of who i was personality wise.

To start off with, I'm not suffering from any sort of mental health issue or anything. Now as for why things have been ""weird"", my thoughts are basically on a constant repeating cycle. I hope that makes sense. For months now it's been the same few things running through my mind over and over again. Some of thoughts I have that occur less frequently as the others are worries of me losing my loved ones. 

The other, more common, thoughts I have are surprisingly the more bothersome as of recent. As horrible as it's going to sound, these thoughts that I have repeating in my head are essentially saying that everything I do is for attention and that there's nothing wrong with me at all. Basically saying that I'm trying to make there be something wrong me while there isn't actually. That I'm just trying to be like others etc. I know how terrible it sounds, trust me. I feel awful for it. I can't even talk to anyone about it because it'll just confirm that these thoughts are true.

 So, here I am on Reddit with a throwaway account to just fucking vent to strangers because I'm at a loss. And it's just fucking with me entirely. These thoughts start within minutes of waking up in the morning and end shortly before I fall asleep with a possible little break during the day. I'm just so tired of thinking about all of this because it's nearly controlling my life and everything I do, but the thoughts won't stop.

The only thing I know of that'll stop these thoughts is killing myself. I don't want to kill myself, but I really feel like I'm left with no options. It's the only way for me. I don't know when I'll do it. I have a goal for the weekend, but I feel like I'm forcing myself and I know by forcing myself, I'll likely fail. And that'll not alleviate my thoughts any. In fact, it'll probably make them worse. I'm basically just waiting for things to either get bad or for me to get impulsive.

I'm sorry this is long and confusing. And I'm sorry I come off as a horrible person. I just really don't know what to do. Even my only option feels doesn't feel like an ""option"".

I feel completely hopeless, it's like everything bad that could happen to someone keeps happening to me, against all odds. I was never religious or superstitious, but it's becoming hard not to believe in luck or a higher power now. I often feel like I'm being punished for something, because it just doesn't make any sense how bad things are.

I want to explain but I don't even know where to begin. This year, and very recently, I only just realized just how messed up I am and how badly I need help. I guess I didn't see it before because I am incredibly stubborn and have a massive inferiority complex, so I thought I could handle it on my own. But I can't.

I don't know when it started. I don't think I've ever been normal. To start the list, I can't seem to get close to anyone. I've never had a real friend - only people I *occassionally* make small talk with who I eventually end up never seeing again. I don't even know how to make friends. The only time I tried was when I was in college (UK college - so I was 16 at the time) for a year. I thought it would just *happen* because I was on a specific course with people who I'd share interests with - but it didn't. I talked to them, they talked to me. It's not like I sat in the corner silently the whole year, in fact I was often the center of attention. But I just didnt feel any connections, and never talked to them again after I left.

I think there's something wrong with me. I don't even care for my own family, in fact I barely tolerate them. I also never felt loved by them, at all. In fact I remember as a child, I thought that the exchange of ""I love you"" between parent and child was a formality, like saying please and thank you just because you're told it's polite.

But it's not that I don't WANT to feel something for someone. I am horribly lonely. Every day I wish I could meet someone who cares about me, and who I care about. I spend so much time daydreaming fantasy scenarios where I'll meet someone like me and I'll finally have someone. 

I should confess to my horrible, dark secret of a coping mechanism. I have been making up friends online for years. I have several, I make them accounts on things, I act like they're my real friends. 

It started as just kind of like a storytelling thing, I guess. Then it became a placeholder for friends, because I had no one and it was comforting. I thought I would quickly be rid of it when I got real friends, but that never happened. It has now been six years. And I've only just realized the real weight of the situation.

I don't know what to do. I don't know if there's any way to fix the situation I'm in. I don't want to die, I really want to live.

I have awful health anxiety that stops me from getting a job or committing to anything. I always feel awful, physically and mentally, from stress and never sleeping enough. On top of that, even if I wasn't too worried about my health to move away spontaneously, I feel like my family is purposefully holding me back, refusing to help me when I ask, not letting me have simple stuff like my own bank account or even a phone that isn't probably under their control, and they don't encourage me to get a job or do anything, they seem perfectly content with letting me waste my life away. I'm an adult, but they treat me like a retarded child that's a burden to them.

Adding insult to injury, I sometimes feel hopeful, but it's quickly ruined by another bad thing that logically shouldn't be happening one after the other so fast. 

I don't know if anyone is reading this. But I desperately need help. I'll do anything to get out of this! I just want to live a decent life and not always be suffering alone... is that really too much to ask for?

4552,"i'm not wrong or weak for getting the help I need Hours after lashing out at me and calling me a lazy piece of shit for falling so behind in school, my dad came downstairs and apologized. He said he never, ever wants to speak to me like that again but he doesn't know what else to do. I told him I need professional help and it hurts to admit that. 

After having my hand held all throughout elementary and middle school, wishing people would just let me be independent and accountable for myself, I realize now how essential that hand-holding was/is.

I have ADHD, a chronic condition, and depression and these things take a significant detriment on my ability to be successful. **I cant go on anymore ignoring that fact.** As much as I want to ignore that fact and try to use willpower to push through the pain, I cant. I'm going into 2018 starting therapy and that isn't a bad thing. 

I want to be successful and feel a sense of drive in life again. I'm sick of my unwashed, awful smelling hair, sick of sleeping in bed until 4 PM, sick of failing classes, sick of crying myself to sleep, and sick of spending hours aimlessly playing video games instead of pursuing the things that make me happy.

625,"This suicidal girl is disgusting me. [READ FIRST.] Feedback is appreciated, but the intentions of this post are to collect my feelings about the predicament I'm in.

There's this suicidal girl in my class who holds a significant crush on me, but I don't like her back, partially for reasons which will be mentioned subsequent important principle information.

I've gone through an unstable, and vulnerable span of 2 years, and I'm holding on in an endeavor to find a purpose to my actions,  so my reactions are but pure ignorance to mental illness. I personally have never cut, and I can understand why people cut.

This girl aforementioned has attempted suicide twice in the past year. She has cuts on both of her wrists that span across half of the circumference of her forearm. Over her arms, notebooks, etc, she writes ""FAT"", ""DIE"", ""KYS"", and ""UGLY."" The reason that I hold contempt for this girl is that while others struggle to contain their emotions to themselves for the sake of others, this girl is prominently joyful, and happy about this.

This girl remarks self depreciation aloud after every comment one may make, and with great enthusiasm remarks that she needs to die, her cuts sting, she wants to kill herself, etc. I believe it is great to be able to discuss moving on past prior hardships, and being able to recover, but with this girl, she shows no effort in recovery, or even a desire to recover. She flaunts her scars, and repeats these awful things with a huge smile, and laughter, and it makes me disgusted at her, as she attempts and put depression and suicidal tendencies in a good light. She still writes on her body, and adds new cuts on herself to later flaunt with a sense of chauvinism that makes me hold contempt towards her.

What do you guys think? I just wanted to rant and organize the predicament to maintain a logical reaction, and overview on this. Feedback is appreciated as well to gather outside opinions of the subject. Thank you for reading.",off_my_chest,ID40950_off_my_chest,"

3983,"I don't know what to do anymore. TLDR: My best friend died, an ex fucked me up mentally, a doctor didn't listen, I'm on the verge of actually doing something. Help?


My life has gone down drastically in the past years. My best friend died about five years ago and thats when everything started to go down hill. That's when I started getting depressed. 


After his death I didn't eat for days, didn't talk to anyone for a few days except for another close friend who I'll call G. Overall it was a bad time. Eventually things went back to normal, for the most part. I was still upset at the loss of a good friend, but that's expected. 


My friend G stared dating someone (we will call him D). Ever since I knew G she told me nothing but bad thing about D, plus I knew him and knew that they were true. He was abusive, manipulative, would use her for nothing more than sex. He wouldn't even let her have any friends. And sure enough shortly after they got together she stopped talking to me, blocking me on Facebook and everything.


I saw that coming when she first got back with him, so did all if her other friends, but I was still upset. I didn't try to contact her just because I knew she wouldn't answer, I knew she wouldn't be with him long and I was right. About a year later I added her mom on Facebook and then G messaged me through that account saying she missed me and wanted to see me again. 


We eventually did hang out again a few days later and she tells me everything that's happened in the last year and I try to talk her in to getting away from the abusive bf. She tells me she wants to, but she's afraid to. This goes on for awhile. About a week later she does break up with him and another week passes and she and I start dating.


Now this is something I had always wanted, I loved this girl ever since I knew her so to be able to finally be dating her was a literal dream come true. 


We were dating for about half a year until one night she didn't answer my texts for a few hours. I get worried that something happened (she went to the store so I thought maybe she crashed) but she eventually texted back saying she got busy with something else. The next day at school she pretty much avoids me untill the end of school when she starts crying and says she doesn't want to hurt me then goes to her next class and breaks up with me over text after school. 


She explains that the reason she didn't text back the night before is because she ran into D at the store and he talked her into getting back with him (she didn't use those words, but that's what happened). 


So as usual she breaks up with me, blocks me, and we don't talk for about another year until we were in class together and I got tired of not talking to her so I decided to talk to her myself. I don't remember what happened exactly all I remember something funny happened with a flag and so I helped her with it.


From then we started talking again in that class. Eventually things got going again and she started saying how she wanted to break up with D, but was afraid to. She and I almost started dating again even, but something happened, I don't know if D found out we were talking or what but she got scared and stopped talking to me for about a week. 


Eventually we started talking again. I had me and her stay back while the rest of the class left so I could talk to her and I managed to get her to start talking. We even kissed, it was kind of cute. 
She did break up with D and we got back together. This time for a year and half.


After that she broke up with me again and, you guessed it, went back to D and again blocked me and it's been that way ever since. It's been about three years since she broke up with me and I'm still upset. It's not so much that she broke up with me, it's that she went back to him. 


I found out just the other day that Sue's no longer with him though so I'm happy about that, but she's getting married this weekend. I'm not sure why that hurts as much as it does. 


Anyways I tell you all this because according to my friends I used to be happy, but now I don't really show any emotions at all. 
Not to mention I've been having suicidal thoughts on and off recently and when I learned G was getting married they came back and worse than ever. I actually feel like I might do something this time.


My friend tells me that he thinks G fucked me up with all the times she played with my heart by leaving me and completely ignoring me because he can tell a difference in my personality. 


I know I need, but I honestly don't know where I go. The last person I tried to get help from hardly let me get a sentence out before just prescribing me pills so I never went back. 


I'm scared and I don't know what to do.


EDIT: More stuff added below.


I forgot to add in the original post about my job and just over all my life. I recently got promoted to nightshift supervisor where I work which is pretty cool I guess, and I was happy because I thought it would help me get over all the rediculous fears I have like picking up the phone, or actually talking to people, but it's just made it worse and I've got more stress now than I did when working normally. I don't want to talk to my boss about it because I went to him and asked to be moved to supervisor. 



I also still live with my parents. I absolutely hate living here. Everything about my parents annoy me and stress me out. They are constantly wanting me to give them money and I refuse because, 1 they are terrible at saving money and I don't want to be part of that, and 2 I know my money always hides money from my dad so my mom always has money somewhere so I never want to give her any for that reason and her constant ""give me money"" stresses me out. it would be different if she didn't actually have anything. Not to mention my dad just spent money buying a guitar. Money he didn't have. 


My mom is one of the laziest people I've ever seen. She refuses to bend her arm just to get a remote, mouse, drink, etc. She'll make my dad get up to get it even though all she needed to do was lean a little. 
My dad has used tissue piled up on his computer desk, they both have used tissue all in the floor of their room. They blame it on the dog, but if that was true it could be stopped. 


They stress me out. Whenever I'm out with friends I'm completely fine and my stress level actually goes down. I can't stand being around my parents. All this plus everything in the original post just adds on to my mental health. ",suicide_watch,ID20714_suicide_watch,"

3374,"Does anyone else's mind jump straight to the worst possible conclusion whenever anything happens? [mini vent] So context, I was sitting in my house, and this loud boom happened. It even shook the house a bit. I went outside to see if I could find the source, but I couldn't. My mind instantly went to ""its the end of the world."" We have had several dead limbs fall out of the trees around the house, so its very likely a small limb broke off and hit the roof shaking the house, but my mind obviously says otherwise.

This happens to me all the time. If my mom doesn't answer her phone, clearly it means she is dead, if my friends don't text me back, they all secretly hate me. I'm 24 and single, so I'm clearly going to die alone. If I hear a strange noise I can't immediately identify, then its obviously something sinister like nuclear war, or apocalypse.

[[venting]] I used to be religious. I grew up christian, and went to church and considered myself to be fairly devout, but the anxiety started coming up, and the doomsday prophecies kept coming in, and I had no way to calm down, so I stewed in absolute misery begging for God to help me. This is where my mind started to do the worst case scenario thing. Every little noise was TORTURE to me. I was unable to function as a human for a couple of months. 2012 was the worst of it. But then December 22 rolls around and there's already a new prophecy circulating, so its a never ending struggle having this in the back of my mind, and dealing with the constant fear of every tiny little sound.

2867,"Today's my birthday! ...and my evil ex decided today was a good day to apologize? Let's take you back to Summer 2010. I was a lonely soon to be senior in high school, and this guy reached out to me on Facebook. I recognized him from school and said, why not you seem nice I'll talk to you. 

Ladies and gents, he was not nice. He was emotionally manipulative and abusive. He had a lot of issues and used them as fuel to do things he knew I didn't want to do. I don't feel like going into more detail than that. 

We got together June 8th. My birthday is on November 8th, and he would constantly tell me in the MONTH that we dated that he was going to propose to me on my 18th birthday. It freaked me out. It I wasn't able to leave him until a friend helped me out. 

He stalked me at school until I got the school involved and he was forced to stop. Ever since I graduated, he's messaged me every once and a while to ""apologize"" for what he did to me both during and after our relationship. I always ignore and block. 

He usually makes a new Facebook account to try to contact me. Guess what he did today!!! 

I was having an amazing birthday until I looked down at my phone at 5:35 PM and I have a Facebook notification saying ""Jack Ass wants to connect with you.""  The last time he tried to get in contact with me, it was two years ago and he tried to follow my Instagram. I've locked all my profiles down since then, or so I thought. 

All he did was try to apologize for ""what he put me through after our relationship"" and I'm honestly like ""no fuck off."" I haven't said anything, I don't plan on saying anything. I just want him to leave me alone forever. I said as much the first time he tried this in 2011. I'm just so upset that this is still coming up in 2017.

I tried to reengage with life, joined a band, went out etc., but I noticed when those feelings are gone, I feel somehow uncertain.

Let me explain: My main concern which already transformed into one huge belief is that I think I should've died a few months ago. It is incredibly hard to shake these feelings off. They became a part of me.

But whenever I am distracted and away from my triggers and not focusing on this belief, I am relatively fine. But as the time goes on, I notice that I CONSCIOUSLY go in this bad neighbourhood in my head and search for the bad thinking patterns again, because I think they define me in some strange way. The feelings feel like they are part of my personality and like connected to my existence, that is the reason I have so many difficulties letting these damn thoughts go. So it is not like anxiety that you are 100% sure that you want to get over these thoughts, this time they are much more powerful, darker and it feels like I CANT AND DONT WANT TO GET OVER THEM.

Everytime these feelings hit, I feel like I shouldnt be experiencing this very moment anymore. I have an appointment with a therapist on 15th of January.

1970,"I feel at my worst when I'm with my family Honestly, I always dread it when I'm summoned to family gatherings or when I have to hang around my family. I always sort of 'steel' myself by thinking of stronger thoughts like ""It'll be all over in two hours"" or ""Just sit there, look like you're listening, but think of something you like instead"". 
I'm always the butt of the jokes. I'm different to all of them. I wish I was normal of course. I'm a naturally quiet individual, and prefer to be on my own and silent. Except, when I'm with close friends, you'll find it near impossible to shut me up. Yet with my family, I don't want to say a word just in case somebody tears me apart or makes a joke from what I'm saying or doesn't listen properly or just talk over me. It's honestly exhausting and frustrating. 

My solution may be to just never, ever go to another family gathering. Drastic, perhaps, but here is my logic: we find it ridiculous if we have friends that make us feel bad and yet we still keep them in our lives, so why should it be different with family? Because they're blood related? Don't think that's a strong enough argument for me. 

If your friends treated you like you don't matter and like you're less than them and make fun of you (but nobody else) every time you're with them, then you'd probably be advised to never ever speak to those bunch of  'friends' again. 

So why should it be different with family?

Perhaps stopping going to family gatherings may be a way of self-improvement for me and will help me to get out of this depression abyss a little more? 

I'm just asking for advice here. Give me your opinions :)

1996,"Dream of future self So, I have a really strange feeling right now that I can't fully describe. 
Yesterday I had a dream, where I was hanging out with my friends, who are not even real people I know. Suddenly we were in the future, and met our future selves. Some strange voice told us that we had just enough time to ask them one question.  
My friends were excited, asking about their career, their study, and got great answers. And my future me was standing there, waiting for my question, the last one.  
So I asked her, ""Did you win?"".  
She replied in disappointment, ""Look at me and tell me if you think that I won."" Then everyone disappeared.  
I was there, alone, surrounded by ""tapes"" of my future everyday life, if that even makes any senses, struggling, thinking that tomorrow I would suddenly have a different mindset and I would be normal again. But no, the days are the same, for years, nothing changes. The worse part is that I can't escape that, because it is really my future. There is nothing that I can do to change it.

I have depression, diagnosed ADHD, anxiety and procrastinate chronically. 

I don’t feel anything anymore, my sense of time is getting warped and I don’t care what happens. Nihilism has gripped me and I’m okay with that. 

But I still try. I cook everyday,  I do my assignments and carried my team in college towards high grades and try to exercise to fix my back. I socialise and am well liked by people but I keep pushing them away. My main problem is that I self sabotage and whenever I get an open spot where I’ve ‘handled’ life I immediately sabotage it and kill any momentum I had generated and fall into depression again. I keep having delusions of grandeur that I can will myself out of this and finally be the person I imagine I can be. 

It’s a pendulum between a dark abyss and shining redemption and I’m tearing myself apart oscillating between them. All I want is to have stability. Sigh. 

Right now after helping my team with college I’ve ghosted them since 3 days and have missed calls and messages on my phone. I look at it and am trying not to open whatsapp lest they see that I’ve ‘seen’ the messages. It’s a dread soup. ",off_my_chest,ID18511_off_my_chest,"

242,"I get horrible thoughts that lead to panic attacks, am I insane/sick? 😭 So last week one night I couldn't sleep as normally. Every time I tried to fall asleep I would get a ""mini panic"" attack over and over I didn't end up falling asleep till 6am that night.

Since then I had some weird issues, I feel constantly stressed, I get headaches randomly that last for only a few minutes on small areas in my head. My short term memory is AWFUL I feel completely blank in my thoughts (feels like I don't think of anything). I get mini dizzy attacks like anxiety but these dizziness attacks I can get even if I'm playing a game or don't felt stressed at all. I get a ""pressure"" feeling around my face, I also have a very hard time concentrating since that night.

I also get thoughts! Thoughts that I gonna die or someone will die. This is what kept me up 3 nights this week. It can be thoughts like:

""me randomly fainting when I'm in a corner at my house and when I wake up its fire all around and I end up getting burned cause I'm stuck"".

""What if my moms ex boyfriend comes to us on nights with a gun trying to kill us"" (even doe this will never happen)

Last thought that have came a lot is... So I'm gay and my dads parents are homophobic, but they don't know I'm gay cause I haven't told them. And I walk with them sometimes just to go outside and we normally go in a forest. So sometimes I think that they gonna hit me from behind and try kill me cause they ""might figured out I'm gay"". Today when we talked I felt like crying cause I was so scared this was gonna happen.

Worth mentioning: I have anxiety, social anxiety. I don't work, school I been home since June when I finished high school, just to take a break and this year I wanna try get a job.

What is wrong with me, this drives me crazy! I have a appointment to my therapist on the 18th but that's such a long time.

87,"All of the titles in this sub are the same so I'm not going to bother I don't know what to do. I never have, and that's why I keep getting worse. I have always had crippling social anxiety and a general social ineptitude which has lead me to be unemployed as a recent grad and very lonely. I haven't so much as stepped outside of my front door in weeks. I don't have a good relationship with my family or any of my friends. I don't talk to anyone except myself and maybe a few sentences to my mother every few days. Even if I didn't have this anxiety, I know that I wouldn't be able to relate to any of the people around me, and I'd perhaps be even lonelier being exposed to proof that I'm the odd one out in every setting. It often seems that everything that I am is at odds with the rest of the world.

I don't know how anyone with these kinds of issues gets help because I can't seem to ask for any. The most I can do is I'll tell my mother that I don't have any interest in the world, that I think everything is terrible, that I can't so much as spend time in the vicinity of other people, even family. I say that I'm tired of everything, that I don't know what to do anymore. I know it shouldn't be her responsibility to deal with my shit, especially when my only interactions are to complain, but she doesn't really react. It makes me wonder if this negative, paranoid failure is just who I am. Maybe nobody expects me to ever be anything more than that.

I should be at least applying to jobs, but the thought of interviewing terrifies me, even though I've done it before. The idea of meeting anyone new is horrifying. The harder it gets to pitch myself to an employer, the less eager I am to do so.

I don't think I'm depressed in the typical sense of the word. I have more of a philosophical depression that arises as a logical progression from my position in life and the state of the world I live in. I don't know if there's a fix for that. Maybe, just maybe, when we feel things like this it's because it's a reflection of a broken world, not an indication that we're sick as individuals. That's an even more worrying thought. Regardless, I'm having trouble finding any reason not to end things other than guilt, but the guilt is enough to stop me, so all I'm left with are these shitty thoughts of self-loathing.

I don't know how to handle this zugzwang that is my life. I can go on and work hard to pretend that I'm fine and act like the other people around me at the expense of myself or I can spend a few years sorting my problems out only to eventually realize that the logical part of me still feels terrible about everything, even at the peak of my elation.

I just turned 14, Had a death wish since I was 5, Life is purposeless and I have no future ahead of me and my life has been crashing down on me ever since I was fucking born, I'v been struggling through this since I was fucking 5 and no one's noticed me/given ONE single fuck, 21/02/2018 5 am australian east coast time (6 hours away from this original post time) I will be ending it, I will be gone from this shitty fucking life once and for all and I know hell isn't as bad as this shit hole.

My last words? Fuck everyone, Fuck my 'dad' Fuck my 'brother' fuck my 'friends' and fuck you to all those 9 kids who I'v beat up during grade 7, You deserved a nice beating.

Though it seems like something an attention whore would do what I'm doing right now doesn't it? Well the reason I'm here? To genuinely ask if there is a future after this, I don't want no fake comments about how it's worth it when it's not I want someone to explain to me who has the knowledge on why it's 'really worth it', Till then peace.

4945,"why cant i stop remembering this every single day. why did i had to be fucked up. why wont it go away i feel like my life is over. i feel like my life has been over for years now.

my parents were very negligent when i was a kid. we were poor and they didnt have a lot of time to watch over me because they were always working. at the time i was around six years old, i was raped by the only person i trusted. this memory got buried for years, but never goes away entirely. it always comes back.

i don't feel like i can trust people. i have no friends. i've never had any friends. i've always being alone. always a fuck up. i get scared and i cry a lot very easily. i never made any friends when i was younger because i was too scared. now, in my 20s, i still feel like a child. i still can't connect to people. i don't think i ever will. i'm gonna die the way that i lived: alone, and too afraid to talk to anyone.

this past year has been the worst. all these memories keep coming back constantly. i tried to make friends and failed miserably. everyone pities me, but no one actually wants to be friends with me. they treat me like i'm slow and need help. but i'm always pushed to the sidelines. 

i feel like i'm just wasting my time. all the other people in their 20s around me already have lifelong friendships, experiences, talents, they go to parties and get along with everyone. but i have none of that. i'm broken. i have nothing good going for me. i've wasted my entire life being too scared to live or to call out the people who hurt me. theres no reason for me to continue with this shit. if i get my degree i'll never get a job anyway: i can't deal with people and can't make connections. i'm useless. 

on monday, i was talking to the man who abused me all those years ago (i hate him so much, but i can't seem to ever cut him out of my life. even after the sexual abuse. even after he beat me. even after all the pain he has caused me. i never let him go. i don't know why. he's nice to me now but i can't ever forget. i just never let go because he's one of the only people who know me and will talk to me). he made a joke about rape. this isn't the first time he has made rape jokes around me.

he doesn't care about the pain he caused me. he doesn't care that he's the reason i've never had a realtionship with a man in my entire life. he doesn't care that i still cry about what happened. he makes fun of the fact that i have no friends. even though his abuse is what made me broken in the first place.

and that man, is one of the only people i have left. and he doesn't fuckin care. other than him, i have my mother. who does not believe in mental illness and won't get me on meds. she doesn't believe i'm depressed. she also knows about the abuse, but has never said a thing, i don't think she cares either. i also have a SO who i see a few times per month. this SO knows that i've been thinking about suicide, but the only words i was told were ""how do you expect me to react?!"" after crying their life out and leaving shortly after. this is the people i have in my life.

i tried therapy and i stopped going. the doctor was a man who asked me sexual questions, and i got very scared and stopped going. i know i sound paranoid, but i can't help but to be afraid of him. about six months ago, the vet who was taking care of my dog groped me during our session. i was too scared to say anything and i didn't tell anyone about it. if i'm honest, living in this shithole thirdworld country, i was scared that the doctor from therapy would touch me too. i don't want anyone to touch me ever again. 

i can't stand being around people. all they do is hurt me. i can't stand being in this world and being nothing. i can't stand that these memories never go away. i can't stand to know that i'm never going to be good for anything. i'm too scared of people (and people are always scared of me too) to ever do anything. i can't make friends, i can't get a job, i can't go outside for too long, i can't even go to therapy for too long, i can't stand this world whatsoever. i hate this place so much. i just want to die. i'll probably just OD. i originally wanted to hang myself, but i heard you can fuck it up and i can't stand the idea of failing and having to to live in pain alone for 20 more years or so.

I went to public school until third grade when my mom met my stepdad, he was a conspiracy theorist who thought school just brainwashes kids to be followers of the elite corporations, he was unemployed with no money when he moved in and stayed that way.
He convinced my mom to homeschool me,which she only did once a week until sixth grade. After that nothing. I never had any interactions with anyone else other than them my whole childhood.

When I turned twenty I miraculously passed the GED test and got a drivers license and was kicked out of the house by my stepdad. I was homeless and got a minimum wage jobs and roommates that never worked out, because I had no social skills and still don't. I always had anxiety and depression over my working, education and social skills.
So I broke down and tried suicide, got community mental health and approved for disability and section 8.
I have been living off this for a few years, but still have no friends and can't enjoy anything. Not even movies or music because I see people living full meaningful lives in movies and singing about love in songs.

The most random things can ""trigger"" it, and sometimes it just happens haha. I despise it and myself for it really. I need to be more stable.

Of course I went through the subsequent stages of grief and got over it. Yet I still remain friends with her .  However midway during training, she’d blocked me on every social media , from skype, Facebook and Instagram to even LINE. I thought it was strange at first but reasoned to myself that these current dates was an exam period for students. I kept quiet and tried to stay calm , telling myself that she was busy. I got so used to that reason that I assured myself it was normal . It was not .
A week ago, I received several texts from her friends that she hasn’t been coming to school for a few weeks and her family told me that she hasn’t been herself and started acting strange , like all of sudden , locking herself in her room and such .
As I am currently serving national service, and she is overseas , I feel so hopeless, yes we broke up , but even as a friend , I cared for her deeply . Now  something is happening to her and I can’t do anything about it .

So, my sister has always had some mental issues, but over the last year or so, she's been getting worse. Her addiction to weed has been joined by an addiction to beer, and she's flying off the handle more than ever; throwing things, hitting walls, slamming doors, yelling and screaming. She's seen psychologist after psychologist, but she bullshits them into believing that she's much less of a wreck than she is. Living with her is torture; I have to walk on eggshells all the time. Say one thing wrong - even just suggesting that drinking beer with anti-anxiety pills is probably not a good idea - and she flies into a rage. I can't talk to her at all.

It was easier to handle when I had dad as backup, but two weeks ago, he woke up and couldn't use his arms. He was diagnosed with brain cancer. He has been in the hospital since then, fighting to regain the use of his arms, getting radiation treatment, needing nurses to help him do basic things like washing himself. He's depressed and frustrated, and I don't know how to help him.

Since he's been away, my sister's tantrums have escalated to a new level. I never know when she's going to do something crazy. I am - frankly - terrified. The smallest noise in the house has me jumping like a horror-movie jumpscare. I don't know how to deal with her and her episodes. It's like living with a violent, hormonal teenager.

1904,"Acceptance...for now. I've been on disability for a good while now. Anyone on disability can probably relate to the strong desire to be away from it. The Social Security office generally treats you like a criminal, you never know who agrees with the negative stigma and sees you as some sort of lazy leach on society, and some days, you fight with the notion yourself. Many people tie worth to one's ability to work and contribute, and it's easy to fall into that realm of thought where you feel worthless and ashamed. 

Anyway, to my story. Around June last year, I was put on a game-changing medication. My anxiety disappeared seemingly overnight, and I felt more confident and comfortable than I have for most of my life. Gears started turning in my head. I could go out among the people! Maybe I could find some companionship and stop feeling so lonely. Maybe I could earn my keep and feel some pride for a change.

This lead to me starting a second part-time job with the intention of ramping up my hours carefully and slowly, the goal being to eventually be making enough to support myself without the SSDI check, Medicare, etc. I was certain I was on track to being an honest, ""normal"" person. I took on more and more responsibilities. Things were looking good for about 6 months.

Then the medication turned on me, as it seems they all eventually do. Every day, things get worse. While it still keeps the majority of my anxiety at bay, I now have a persistent depression. I've lost interest in many things, including wanting to do a good job at work. I let things slip, do the bare minimum, and count each second until I am able to go home. Increasing hours at a job that I am having less and less of a tolerance for seems like a good way to speed up an inevitable crash and burn. If something doesn't change soon, I will likely have a breakdown and/or wind up in the hospital.

And for what?

Before I started the new med and took the second part-time job, I was doing okay for myself. My first part time job was enough to keep me connected to the outside world, even though the pay might have been considered token at best. I kept myself busy with personal projects. At times I felt lonely, but I had friends. I had trouble with anxiety and depression, but I had time and space to cope. 

In my current situation, I feel like I'm on a speeding train. There are no time-outs when I am feeling terrible. What time I have for my own interests is tainted by dread of the next workday and this consistent, low current of depression. The second part-time job has made the first one, *the one I found rewarding and enjoyable,* feel like an inescapable chore. All I want to do now is go home and hide. All this effort put in to build a ""respectable life"" and dig myself out from under disability, and I feel so much more frightened, fragile, and trapped than before. 

No medication has been effective for me for such a long duration. I was certain it was the one, so I ended up biting off more than I could chew. Now, I'm dependent on a drug that makes me miserable and puts me in a precarious emotional state every day. I stress out and hide from my responsibilities. Every day I feel inadequate and not up to snuff. 

And why? Because I felt guilty for being on disability? Because I was certain that life free off it would be better? That I couldn't have companionship, self-worth, or be among the living if I wasn't earning my keep in traditional terms?

After much thought, *I have made a conscious choice to ""regress.""* Clearly, working full time is not an attainable goal for me right now. I'm cutting my current average of 15 hours per week at my second job to around 7. Between it and my first job, I'm likely looking at around 10 a week, which I think will be manageable. Also, I'm getting off the ""wonder drug"" that keeps my anxiety at bay at the cost of my sanity and happiness. I will regroup, stabilize, and *find some damned peace.*

Being off disability wasn't in the cards this time, and *that's okay.* There's a reason I was put on it in the first place. Maybe I will find an opportunity to be financially independent in the future, maybe not. But I will stop with the self-shaming. I can still have a worthwhile life, whatever the circumstances. 

**TL;DR - I found a wonder drug, thought it would finally get me off disability. It didn't, and that's okay. Life goes on.**

*EDIT: Added TL;DR and fixed some grammar.*",bipolar,ID12196_bipolar,"

.

Your beautiful face,

I breathe in memories of the smile you once had for me and it fills my lungs with hope.

Hope carried by my blood through my veins and into my soul. 

Like a bat I send out my signal, 

“I love you…”

I await its return, the echo that navigates me through my day.

Nothing.

“I love you”,

 “I love you”, a thousand times more I shout into your darkness,

Your silence returns as a thousand angry daggers, invisible in the black abyss.

The blades rend flesh and spirit, and though I am bloodied and weak, I stand.

Clinging to life, I smile. 

“I’m okay”

“I’m okay”, a thousand times more I say to myself.

The peaceful repetition attempts to soothe my being, fighting back against the crashing waves of would-be tears.

The tide swells and calms, slowly eroding the bedrock of my faux defenses, and I crumble to the ground.

“I’m sorry”

“I’m sorry”, a thousand times more I cry out.

The words tiptoe to your ear in vain, as the burning eruption of your anger turns them to ash.

The molten rage slams into my ocean of tears, and encompasses me in a cage of obsidian.

Clawing back at your rage I try to hold on, but the heat is too much to hold on to, and I being to sink.

Down

Down I fall farther into the abyss of my own sorrow. 

Searching for hope I close my eyes and try to remember your beautiful face,

And the smile it once had for me. 

But it’s gone.

I hope I live to see cancer cured, see an amazing VR Elder Scrolls installment, maybe visit Mars, ect, but die before we have total biological immortality, robot death drone armies, government foolproof tracking our loyalties, shit like that


I want to see Alzheimer’s be cured but I want old people to still have peaceful deaths, just with their full personalities intact instead of mentally wasting away first. I’m so fucking terrified of EVERY ailment being cured INCLUDING basic old age. Poor people wouldn’t access it, the rich would switch from young body to young body. It’d be devastating and pointless to lose a loved one. It feels that way now, but there would legitimately be no meaning anymore. If I’m hit by a car one day, we still have the comfort that death is universal and old age would have gotten me anyway. Even without heaven, the idea that we are all drops that return to the ocean, even if that’s unconsciousness. What do we cling to if nobody has to die and you wouldn’t have died at all if you hadn’t walked outside that day??? Or if the robodoctors had gotten there five seconds earlier?? And you have to go a thousand years grieving like that???

I know grouchy old people think of millennials as never talking to each other and always wired, but I really think the balance is pretty good right now. I can reach out whenever I need, I can put away my phone and be alone. I couldn’t bear to live in a world where I can only talk to my girlfriend every other day for an hour- our skyping and texting have brought us together so much. But also I’d go absolutely insane if we had some sort of “brain-texting” where people could hit me up inside my own mind whenever they want.

This is my biggest symptom that scares me, and to a degree I feel it almost 24/7. Have you ever turned your head real fast from one direction to another, and felt a lil off balance (especially looking from down to up)? That's how I feel whenever I turn my head at any speed at any direction, always. Most times its so slight I can barely notice it, if I keep busy I won't think about it for most the day. But when I notice it, Im so aware of it that I'll keep my head straight for most of the day and my neck goes REALLY stiff because of so. I hate it. It's gotten to the point that I'm just so mad I feel it, I start waving my head left and right, bouncing up and down just to see If I can make it worse, to confirm that I ACTUALLY AM feeling this.

Never do I feel like the area around me is spinning, its more internal, like my head is too heavy and bobbles around like a bobble head at the slightest movement. At one point I thought maybe my feet aren't doing a good job of keeping myself balanced. You know when you stay super still, you notice you aren't perfectly still, like your body is still bobbing around a little bit trying to maintain balance , I notice this times 10, I never feel truly still. 

I want to know if this feeling is REAL or not, or if its all in my head, just overthinking my every sensation of reality. When I start thinking about It I start thinking maybe I'm going to pass out, but in the 4 months of having anxiety I have never passed out, even in my worst of panic attacks. It's the worst, walking around can sometimes help it go away or sometimes make me notice it more.
To double on, I get head pressure, usually around the sinuses area, but mostly on the left side of my head (temple area). Now I live in an area where I'm super allergic to most things outside [Mountain Cedar, Oak, Mold, most grasses, Dogs], and guess what, because of anxiety I've found myself going outside a lot to calm me down (I even own a dog), So that's it right? But then why do I still feel it even inside.

I'm so scared that the off balance, the pressure, the ringing in the ears (yeah I have that too) is all signs to a brain tumor. But my doc says its all anxiety, and recommends I don't even try an MRI (my family is poor and our insurance is shit), he says brain tumor would've had worst symptoms like headaches, seizures and blacking out.

Was recently hospitalized for other mental illness though and met a bunch of other severely depressed people, 5 or 6 of whom I had long conversations with. I have a somewhat unique way of thinking about the illness that helps me, and when I shared it, I was very surprised to find that it kind of resonated with them, and I was suggested to post some of it online. So, here we go; hopefully it doesn't come across as too preachy:

Depression is a high proportion of negative thoughts about oneself, whereas most people have an unbalanced proportion of positive thoughts about themselves.

CBT is the common approach to fighting depression. It attempts to reduce the proportion of negative thoughts by encouraging the person to be rational and objective, moving them towards neutral thoughts. This is a lot of work, and it doesn’t answer the simple question: why are the negative thoughts and the pain that comes with them there in the first place?

I now suggest that negative thoughts exist at such high levels in depressed people because, paradoxically, they actually make them feel better for short periods and are therefore encouraged by the reward system. How is this possible? By creating a self-victimization loop, you can avoid responsibility for self-perceived failures. It is a relief to simply give up entirely and say that are simply genetically or environmentally messed up to the extent that there is nothing you can do about your problems. The more the illness takes over, the greater the pressure of failures, and the more relief that can be achieved by welcoming negative thoughts and diffusing responsibility as a victim.

If the self-victimization loop is internally activated and makes people consistently feel relief, we can choose to think of depression as an addiction to this drug of self-victimization. Depressed people are actually addicted to negative thoughts. So how can we fight this addiction if the drug is inside our own brains? Well, like any drug, there are a number of ways that we can fight the addiction:

1. Realize the long-term destruction and misery that addiction to self-victimization is causing. When you become enticed by the prospect of self-victimizing, you can think back to all the pain that they have experienced as a result of the behavior and realize the grave sub-optimality of feeling sorry for oneself.

2. Use techniques from CBT as a way of fighting those negative thoughts which are irrational. However, this approach alone is somewhat incomplete as depressed people have many negative thoughts which are rational. For example, the idea that your brain has a problem causing ceaseless pain and misery is a rational negative thought, as well as the idea that suicide may be a better way out of life.

3. Thus, for fighting negative thoughts that are rational (specifically suicide and self-victimization targeted around the depression itself), I encourage you to intimately understand that these thoughts are encouraged by the addiction to relief via self-victimization, and that they are present not because of any intellectual legitimacy, but instead because they generate a high in the brain, at the cost of devastating impacts on long term happiness. Thus, you can work to avoid these thoughts out of self-interest - they are making you miserable in the long-term; thus it’s to your benefit to avoid them at all costs.

4. Remember that relapse is part of recovery. As a depressed person, your brain is addicted to drug that is free and always available, 24/7. It has terrible recreational aspects, which makes it easy to find the willpower to fight it, but you won’t always win the battle. When your brain does give to the short-term relief of self-victimization, realize that it is okay, and when you snap out of the episode, be quick to disregard the negative thoughts that built up. Realize that these negative thoughts are filling your brain not because they are true (although some of them may be), but because they were motivated by your reward system. Reject those negative thoughts as you would a foreign invader in your mind to recover faster.

5. Realize that depression is a sign that your brain is too smart, not that it is too crazy or too disorganized. This will take away the power of the self-fulfilling prophecy that I am depressed - therefore there is something wrong with me and I should be depressed about that. Depression is going to be an issue for anyone who’s brain figures out how to generate an internal high from the self-victimization loop. Being a depressed person means that your brain has figured out how to do something that other people’s brains have not figured out (even if this means you got some wires crossed). Realize that depression, although exceptional in its propensity to cause pain, is extremely common and not in an of itself evidence of a defective mind. By following reward gradients, your brain is doing something completely, 100% normal - you just have the wrong rewards! But you can change these rewards with discipline.

6. Finding the discipline to modify one’s own thoughts is hard. That’s one of the big limitations of CBT - it just takes a lot of work. But being depressed gives you a major resource for finding discipline - pain! Learn to use your pain as a resource for modifying your behavior. To do this, wait until you are at rock bottom, and then think back to the moment when you decided to start self-victimizing or entertaining suicidal ideations. Realize that all of your pain is the result of your lack of discipline by choosing to follow the easy route of short-term relief, and find the motivation to do better next time. Your brain will magically start to properly associate your decisions with their consequences (which it should have been doing to start with). If your pain starts to go away, you may find it harder to be disciplined in observing and modifying your own thoughts - that’s okay! When the pain comes back, you can get tough again.

7. Don’t underestimate the wicked intelligence of addiction. Addiction is not some dumb part of your brain taking over. It is when your subconscious brain with its full intelligence is fully motivated to perform sophisticated psychological maneuvers to attack yourself, albeit at the cost of long term happiness. Learn to observe all of your thoughts and ask if they are a subtle stepping stone towards self-victimization. Incessantly comparing yourself to friends who are more successful than you? Saying that you have no hope of ever getting better? Developing pseudo physical symptoms like catatonia, shakes, or pains? Secretly seeking out periods of loneliness? Realize if you have depression that a big chunk of your brain is scheming against you as in any other form of addiction. Become a scientist of your own mind and try to discover whether each of your negative thoughts has secretly been supported by the adversary in your own mind. In the long run, you can root out and beat this adversary because in any direct battle, the rational desire to promote your long term happiness will win out over a short term high - but you have to search out and fight the enemy that has been insidiously working against you, extending into all aspects of your mind.

8. Keep these theories in your mind even during an episode. One of the worst aspects of depression is that it tears you down during the self-victimization loop and then when you get out of it, you wonder what the hell just happened, and how you are supposed to have any stable perspectives on life when your brain is filled with such negativity. If you can dig in and believe in this theory, keep it with you even as you are going through an episode. Tell yourself you’re just going to give into your addiction and be suicidal for a little bit, but keep 20% of your brain fighting the good fight, so that when you snap out of the episode you can recover faster.

9. Understand the long term dynamics of depression. If you’ve been depressed for multiple years, it will take some time to introspect your mind using these techniques, but it can help to go back in time to when you first got depressed. The model I’ve proposed suggests that depression is something your brain had to learn how to do - it had to learn the sophisticated acrobatics necessary to generate an internal high from negative thoughts. This could have taken many months, but crucial to generating the high is getting really, really good at self-victimization. The best way to do this is to flood the brain with negative thoughts, as quickly and as extensively as possible. Realize that your brain slowly learned how to do this complicated behavior, but it can also naturally learn to stop doing it if you start associating the behavior with the long term negative consequences instead of the short term relief.

3586,"At first I thought i was bipolar, but now i'm not so sure I'm a 16 year male in my junior year of high school. My freshman year was as basic as could be, but in October of my sophomore year I had my first manic episode (or at least what I think was mania). I was full of energy, got work done so fast my teachers literally couldn't keep up, I was bouncing off the walls and talking the ear off of anyone who would listen. I shot up to the top of my class, reorganized my room, and pretty much planned out my entire life. At the time I thought I was just finally growing up and hitting my stride, but then I crashed. I became severely depressed, my work ethic all but disappeared, and I began to feel just... empty. I would skip school, ignore friends and family, and dropped all of my hobbies like competitive video games and piano lessons.  I would also have bouts of extreme anger, and had one really bad anxiety attack that came literally out of nowhere one morning. I self diagnosed myself with bipolar disorder because it seemed that the symptoms all matched up. However now I am not so sure. I still have the same symptoms, but they don't really fall into either bipolar 1 or 2. My manic or hypomanic phases aren't nearly long enough. The first one I had was the longest by far at about 2 or 3 months. But they have gotten shorter and shorter ever since. They usually only last 1-4 days now. My episodes also vary in severity, depression is much more common for me than hypo mania but sometimes it ranges from a lack of energy and motivation to full on suicidal depression, and the mania ranges from feeling good and alert to feeling like I'm the king of the world and not being able to sit still no matter how hard I try. I know this doesn't match up with traditional bipolar disorder at all, but something is obviously wrong with me and I really want to know what. I have gone to therapy and gotten medication, but the therapy was a really bad experience, and my doctor would just keep prescribing me anti depressants and completely ignore my mood swings. I know this isn't traditional Bipolar disorder, so maybe I should be posting this somewhere else, but this is the closest mental disorder I could find that matches my symptoms, and I've identified as bipolar for so long that this subreddit felt like the only place I belonged for a long time, so hopefully someone here knows what I'm talking about.

2459,"Current situation Im 15 years old, ever since a young kid I felt that I got anxious when talking to people, it felt the longer I talked, my heart rate would increase and i would look down and my words would all jumble up. I also felt that i had to say things when with classmates, most of the time they would sound stupid and I would get bullied and teased daily for it. In my head i felt like I new how to be normal but it frustrated me that i couldnt fit in. This was around year 9-10 (13-14 years old)(this was also the time when my psoriasis started on my knees and spread everywhere). As of right now Im in my second week of the school holidays, ive just scraped by for ncea level 1, with the help of a doctors note saying that I have an anxiety disorder, which helped me get a standadized grade for the exams i didnt go to. I started on anti-depressants a week or two before the exams, I smoked on them, I drank on them. I literally just tried to fit in with the crowd which I feel like ive always tried to do. Now im off them and have been off them for around a week, i feel worse than ever, I feel dumb, ive had this brainfog for years (feels like there's something inside my forehead) dont really want to leave the house and just yesturday I went to the supermarket and i literally couldnt function, I didnt know what i wanted or anything, at the time I was having this negative cloud of thoughts I couldnt even understand. 

There is no structure to my writing or anything, I also feel so fucking dumb and my memory is terrible and my writing has literally gotten terrible. Im obsessive, about stupid things. I wake up in the morning feeling like shit. I regret smoking weed on those anti depressants because i feel like it fucked me up even more i just need to let go. I regret so much dumb shit ive done but I know i should just let it all go. Ive been seeing a therapist. I have moment where i feel ok or even good, i try to let  my thoughts just be. I tell myself that was a negative thought move on. Everything just seems like shit, sometimes i dont even have that brainfog and i can just function normally but i still have this cloud of negative thoughts. I was literally down at the beach with a friend tipping over a dinghy and jumping off it and swimming in the water but even that didnt stop my negstive thoughts, its gotten to a point where it feels like nothing I do stops them, but i know its not true.

My therapist says that if i smoke anymore I could risk having a psychosis or become skizo. I honestly dont know how i got to this point. I feel like my anxiety is literally controlling my life. 

Ive got to realize that ive done so many good things in my life and that the majority of the bad stuff thats happened was literally out of my control, it was the anxiety.",anxiety,ID21698_anxiety,"

5154,"I have accepted that my dad is most likely a child rapist. Hi all. Not sure what to do with this information, so I figured I should send it off into the void.

My dad has never had a relationship with his siblings, and the reasons why were always really murky. A couple years back, my grandfather told me the truth: when my dad was 15, his younger brother (11) told him that my dad had molested him. My grandfather wasn't totally clear on it, but he used the word rape. Apparently there was also a question about whether it had happened to his other younger sibling, who would have been around 8 at the time.

The excuse my dad gave us (and he did a whole performance, tears and yelling and everything) was that he 'stood up for' his siblings as a kid and they resented him for it. He admitted that he was a bully and used physical force on them and it may have crossed over into abuse. He never, ever admitted to anything sexual.

My dad is an asshole, through and through. But he's always been my asshole. He's a mean SOB who yells at and belittles me, my mom, and my sister and refuses to get help for his anger problems nor his extreme anxiety. He has ruined my confidence, my positive perspective on the world, and my easy going nature. 

That being said...he took me to my hockey games whenever he could. He helped with my homework. We talk about politics and religion and everything else in the world for hours. When he's in a good mood, he is everything to me.

I don't know what to do or what to think. Most of you would probably totally deny that your dads could ever touch a child, but I know that my dad is really fucked up and I don't have much of a problem believing it. That being said, if I'm wrong, then I'm a god awful daughter for believing this about my dad. I just don't know what to do.

Here's to you, void.

Edit: to be clear, my dad doesn’t know we know. I don’t think he even knows my grandpa knows. He gave us the physical abuse explanation after years of me and my sister pestering him over why we didn’t have any family. ",off_my_chest,ID1584_off_my_chest,"

I don’t know who else to turn to for help. I’ve been suffering from severe anxiety and panic attacks for a couple years now, and on and off depression. I’ve been on medication for over 2 years, adjusted by psychiatrists over the years. Been going to weekly counseling with a good therapist for over a year. Today, she told me in session that she didn’t know what else to try. I’ve been doing yoga semi regularly, guided meditation (i mostly just break down into tears when I try), and am holding a good diet. I have a good support system in the form of friends and family. Despite all of this, the stress of being a student and recruiting is destroying me. I’m sleeping 12+ hours every night, and I’m at least one panic attack everyday, and just general anxiety surrounding everything in my life, not to mention having chronic tiredness since high school.

My therapist is highly trained and deals with people from many walks of life, but she doesn’t even know anything else that could help me. She’s providing me with a transfer to another therapist, but this whole situation is making me lose hope. She said that I might need 12 hours of sleep everyday for the rest of my life to help with the low energy. But I can’t live my life like this forever.

Are panic attacks, anxiety, and depression going to be lifelong problems? Has anyone else been able to be functional in life like this?
